Back in Thailand for 2 weeks - visiting the Andaman Coast this time
======

Since the strict 30 day Thai visa didn’t give us quite enough time to explore Thailand our first time around, we decided to visit again after our trip through pensinsular Malaysia and focus on Southern Thailand, specifically the Thai islands and the Andaman Coast  [(Link to interactive map)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1gCfBnXvwngh_llfO96rbRoOqJf6Ps0A&ehbc=2E312F).

Ko Jum (Feb 19-23, 2025)
======

_Beach on Ko Jum_

Somehow 3 months have already past, marking the halfway point of our planned trip through Southeast Asia! To avoid getting burnt out (and to give ourselves some much needed space to plan the second half of our travels), we decided to go chill out in the Thai islands.

_Longboat to Ko Jum_

We booked a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Krabi, Thailand, then took a series of cheap public _songtaews_ to get to the pier where we caught the 4pm longboat to Ko Jum. Unlike its more famous neighboring islands like Ko Phi Phi with its giant resorts and myriad of activities or Ko Lanta with its world-class dive shops, Ko Jum is a tiny island on the Andaman Coast that flies under the radar for most visitors to Southern Thailand (which is a huge part of its charm).

_Bungalow for a few days of relaxing and trip planning_

We booked a private bungalow for 4 nights on Ko Jum and spent our days reading travel guides, taking walks on the beach, and generally doing nothing besides some much-needed trip planning. One day I spent hours reading extensively about Sumatra and coming up with a 2 week itinerary for a visit before deciding that evening that we had neither the time nor budget for Sumatra and cutting the whole thing - clearly time well spent.

Ko Lanta (Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025)
======

After a couple relaxing days on Ko Jam, we took a ferry over to the neighboring island Ko Lanta, which we’d read was one of the best spots in Thailand for scuba diving.

_Sunset by the beach on my birthday in Ko Lanta_ 

Since our first night on Ko Lanta was on my 34<sup>th</sup> birthday, Sara found us a nice restaurant to celebrate (Yang Garden), and, instead of our usual ~$4 meals, we splurged on cocktails and a ribeye dinner with a yuzu-miso beurre bland sauce and truffle mashed potatoes and cauliflower sides - yum (still only set us back ~$30 each!).

_A few days of sporadic heavy downpours and strong winds derailed some early diving plans_ 

We had visited Ko Lanta to go scuba diving at some of the nearby dive sites along the Andaman Coast but our first couple days in Ko Lanta were super windy with sporadic downpours. So, after talking with the nearby dive shop (Flip Flop Divers), we delayed our diving by a couple days until the weather settled down. It occurred to us that over the past 3 months we’ve had remarkably good weather and somehow this was literally the first time that any of our plans had gotten seriously derailed by a few days due to weather! Fingers crossed our luck continues.

_Flip Flop Divers in Ko Lanta_ 

On our 3<sup>rd</sup> day on Ko Lanta, Sara and I got up bright and early and visited Flip Flop Divers to sign up for our PADI Advanced certification course. The two of us were paired with a single instructor for the 2-day course (one of the reasons we picked this slightly pricey dive shop was the guide-to-diver ratio) and set off with about a dozen other divers for the pier to get on the dive boat out to Ko Haa.

_One of our first dive sites in Thailand: Ko Haa #3_ 

For our first day of diving, we visited Ko Haa, a popular dive site that took about 2 hours to get to from Ko Lanta. Since Sara and I were getting certified for our PADI Advanced, our dives were centered around mastering specific skills; for day #1 this meant peak performance buoyancy (becoming more adept at maintaining neutral buoyancy control throughout a dive) and underwater navigation (using a compass and underwater distance estimation to do out-n-backs and swim in a square with a partner).

_Sara and I between dives on the first day of our PADI Advanced course_

Despite most of our time (air) being used up on skills-based learning, we still had plenty of time to see some interesting species such as moray eels and an octopus camouflaging herself on a coral reef. One of the main reasons to get certified for PADI Advanced is to be allowed to visit more advanced dive sites and to dive up to 30m (vs 18m for PADI Open Water) so on our 2<sup>nd</sup> day of diving we started with our deep dive at Ko Bida Nai.

_Day 2 of diving includes a deep dive (30m) which we did here at Ko Bida Nai_ 

Since air consumption increases at lower depths, this was our shortest dive (35min vs 50-60min for the first day). We slowly descended to 29m where we settled on the sandy bottom for a few minutes as our instructor showed us different colored flash cards to demonstrate how depth affects color visibility: as you descend deeper, low-energy wavelengths (e.g. red/orange/yellow) are all absorbed by the water and don’t penetrate as far as high-energy wavelengths (green/blue/purple) resulting in an inability to see colors like red and orange. For the final dive of our certification, we chose the elective Fish Identification and each took turns with a slate board during the dive trying to use our neutral buoyancy control to approach and observe different fish species and write down notes to then ID them back on the boat.

_We made a reservation at the beachfront Fat Turtle Restaurant to catch the weekly fire spinning show_ 

After a day off, we returned to Ko Bida for one last day of dives and managed to see 2m black-tipped sharks, a banded water snake, devil scorpionfish, absolutely **massive** schools of yellowtail snapper, and little porcelain crabs that live alongside clown fish on poisonous anemone. We had hoped to see a leopard shark at our second dive sight since there are relatively reliable sightings there but sadly an amateur underwater photographer from another dive group had scared them all off… too bad, hopefully we’ll get a chance to see one diving in Indonesia or the Philippines!

Krabi Town (March 2-3, 2025)
======

_Krabi Mangrove forest_

After Ko Lanta, our next stop was to visit Tonsai Beach and Railay Beach to go rock climbing since the limestone karsts there have world-famous climbing routes. Since we’d have to go through Krabi Town to get there, we decided to spend one night in Krabi to explore the mangroves there and hopefully spot the elusive [Mangrove Pitta](https://ebird.org/species/manpit1) (spoiler: we did not). Pittas are shy, beautifully-plumaged, passerine birds that are notoriously difficult to spot and thus a source of frequent frustration to birders (case in point, we have yet to see any of the 44 worldwide pitta species).

_Mudskippers and crabs by the Krabi Mangrove forest_ 

Despite failing to find the elusive pitta, the mangrove forests were still worth a visit to see many of the crab species, lizards (including the [Sumatran Flying Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_sumatranus)!, and fish that are only really found among mangroves. The highlight for us was getting to the end of the mangrove boardwalk and spotting dozens of [mudskippers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudskipper), hilarious little amphibious fish with retractable dorsal fins.

Tonsai Beach (March 3-5, 2025)

_Getting off the longboats at Tonsai Beach among the limestone karsts_ 

After one last breakfast of [roti canai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roti_canai) in Krabi Town, we took a _songtaew_ to the nearby (claustrophobically crowded) tourist center Ao Nang. From there we jumped on a longboat headed to Tonsai Beach which can only be reached by boat despite being on the mainland Andaman Coast of Southern Thailand.

Tucked between the much more famous Ao Nang Beach and Railay Beach, Tonsai Beach is a small laid-back beach village with a backpacker/bohemian vibe that is 99% filled with local and international climbers there for the world-class climbing routes on the surrounding limestone cliffs.

_Rock climbing at East Railay Beach (I’m in the top right)_

After a day of settling in and relaxing, we signed up for a half-day of climbing with Basecamp Tonsai, one of the two climbing outfits on Tonsai Beach. Led by a local climbing guide and another instructor, we headed over to one of the limestone cliff-faces on East Railay Beach in a group with a French teenager, a Lithuanian doctor, and two experienced Spanish climbers. We  climbed about a half dozen routes (rated 5c-6b) throughout the morning; despite not having gone top-roping in about 10 years (99% of my climbing experience is gym bouldering), Sara and I managed to complete all but one of the routes. Given my pathological fear of heights, I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to make it up the 20m 6a+ climb - nothing like some peer pressure and encouragement from your belayer I guess!

_Mother and baby dusky langurs hanging out 10ft away from our balcony off Tonsai Beach_

Sara found us a surprisingly cheap guesthouse a walk up the hill from the beach with a balcony where we spent most of our downtime. Not only did the balcony have some of the most stunning views so far on our entire trip but one afternoon we were joined by a half-dozen dusky langurs that hung out in the tree as close as 5ft from us for a couple hours as they happily munched on leaves. The next evening, as we prepared to head inside after sunset since the mosquitoes had come out, we looked up into the sky to see **thousands and thousands** of fruit bats flying directly overhead to go out for their evening feeding. We later learned through some research that these fruit bats were large flying foxes (Pteropus vampyrus), the largest bat species in the world! It would have been easy to stay in Thailand for another week but with Borneo, Indonesia, the Philippines, North Vietnam, and Nepal left to visit, we sadly said goodbye to Tonsai Beach and headed back to Krabi to catch our flight to Malaysian Borneo.
