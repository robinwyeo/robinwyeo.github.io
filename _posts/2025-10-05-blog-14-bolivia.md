Lakes, Jungles, Deserts, and Salt Flats in Bolivia
======

When we began planning our South America trip at the beginning of the summer, we had initially planned to visit Peru, Ecuador, and then Colombia but a conversation with my sister Lara had us re-think our plans and consider including Bolivia instead. The more we thought about it, the more we liked the idea of having our trip take us through more diverse and extreme biospheres, and going from Peru to Bolivia would make Chile a natural next choice, somewhere I’d always been interested in visiting. Our time in Bolivia was spent at Lake Titicaca (the highest altitude navigable lake in the world), deep in the Amazon jungle in Madidi National Park, exploring La Paz, and finally driving across the Salar de Uyuni, the world’s largest salt flat. We may have seen less birds this way than visiting Ecuador and Colombia, but we instead got to experience a whole host of different terrains and landscapes.

Lake Titicaca (Sep 16-20, 2025) 
======

We decided to spend a full 5 days in the picturesque town of Copacabana on the Bolivian side of Lake Titicaca. Lake Titicaca sits at a staggering ~12,500ft and is the largest freshwater lake in South America, famous for being the mythical birthplace of the Incan Empire: according to legend, Lake Titicaca was where the god Viracocha emerged to create the sun and the stars, as well as the first Incan King.

_The whimsically designed cabana we stayed in for a few nights overlooking Lake Titicaca_

Our main goal in Copacabana was to relax and decompress after our last few busy weeks in Peru’s Sacred Valley and Manu National Park so we found ourselves spending lots of time in our wonderfully cute cabana, catching up on journaling, and going through bird photos. We even booked ourselves a place with a fireplace and a kitchenette so we could cook ourselves dinner for the first time in ages. On the subject of food - if you ever visit Lake Titicaca, do yourself a favor and try the fresh caught trout that’s sold right by the lake at a bunch of identical food stalls usually crowded with locals and Bolivians visiting Lake Copacabana on family vacation; it’s super cheap, flavorful, and some of the best trout we tastes on our trip.

_Eight mile hike across Isla del Sol starting from the northern ruins then south along the Ruta Sagrada de la Eternidad del Sol_

On our last day in Copacabana, we caught the 2hr early morning ferry to the northern end of Island de Sol, one of the most important spiritual sites in South America. According to Incan mythology, it was here on the Isla de Sol that the sun god Inti was born and where the first Incan King was sent to Earth. The island is also home to a multitude of archaeological ruins from the Incan Empire as well as pre-Incan civilizations. We spent the day hiking from where our ferry dropped us off (Challapampa), up to the ancient Incan ruins on the Northern end of the island and then back along the high ridge all the way across the entire island down to the Southern town (Yumani) where we caught another ferry for the shorter ride back to Copacabana.

Madidi National Park (Sep 21-28, 2025) 
======

After a quick 1 night stopover in La Paz, we boarded a short 45min flight north to Rurrenabaque, the closest town to Madidi National Park, where we were picked up by a driver from our jungle ecolodge and quickly whisked off to the Beni River to begin our journey upstream into the Amazon. Madidi National Park is located in the upper Amazon River basin and is widely considered one of the most biodiverse protected areas in the world. We planned to spend a week there split between Madidi Jungle Lodge (deep upriver into the jungle) and Sadiri Lodge (located at a higher elevation on the edge of the rainforest) to maximize our chances of seeing different species by choosing different ecological zones. Both of these ecolodges (as well as 4 others in the area) are 100% owned and operated by indigenous families from the San Jose de Uchupiamonas community; this was something we looked especially into when deciding where to stay to ensure that the money we spent would go back into the local indigenous communities and towards the conservation of Madidi National Park (something the Bolivian government has actively tried to abolish for private interests over the last few decades).

Our first day started with a 3hr boat ride upriver towards Madidi Jungle Lodge which was jaw-droppingly pretty as well as one of the craziest upriver boat trips I’d ever been on (the powerful and widely unpredictable currents in these jungle rivers seem untraversable but our boat driver as well as spotter up front knew how to read the water well enough that we safely got through all the rapids and cross-currents). Our boat ride upriver netted us 26 bird species including vultures, terns, herons, skimmers, geese, swallows, swifts, martins, kites, water tyrants, and even a burrowing owl.

_We took a 3 hour boat ride from Rurrenebaque upriver to reach Madidi Jungle Lodge_

During our 4 days at Madidi Jungle Lodge, we typically got up a bit before dawn to walk around for 1-2 hours to spot wildlife and birds with our guide Roberto. We’d then have breakfast at the main lodge followed by 3-4 hours of trekking through the jungle to spot more wildlife followed by lunch and a siesta. We’d then do another 3-4hr trek followed by dinner (and on one night a 2hr night hike to see insects). Our guide Roberto was a local guy in his 40s who grew up in the San Jose de Uchupiamonas community in Madidi National Park and had been guiding for the last 15 years, and probably my favorite guide of the trip (extremely knowledgeable, funny, and kind with a very chill presence that made it easy to spend 7-10hrs trekking together everyday).

Jungle birding is typically pretty tough going - jungles are extremely biodiverse but the birds have a million places to hide off-trail and the trekking is hot, humid, and difficult. That being said, we had decent luck in Madidi National Park; we only saw about 25-30 species per day on the jungle trails but most of these were new to us and often pretty exciting species. Some favorites were the Curl-crested Aracari, Blue-capped Manakin (photo doesn’t do it justice), Cream-colored Woodpecker, Amazonian Motmot, the Undulated and Great Tinamou, White-throated Piping-Guan, White-throated Toucan, Reddish Hermit, Short-tailed Pygmy-Tyrant (the world’s smallest songbird! Sara and I initially thought this was a large bee), and Swallow Tanager (you can find my photos of these birds [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-10-05-portfolio-17-bolivia)).

Of course we weren’t just visiting the Amazon to see birds (though that may have been 80% of our motivation); over our four days at the ecolodge, we also saw 5 different species of monkey: red howler monkeys (mother+infant one day and whole family the next), a troupe of very loud and active spider monkeys, capuchin monkeys, squirrel monkeys (one of my favorite species as a child), and titi monkeys (discovered in Madidi National Park in 2004). We also saw plenty of fascinating (and sometimes scary) insects like the giant wasp that Roberto informed us was nicknamed “friend of man” since its venom routinely kills medium-sized snakes.

For our final day in the jungle, we set out from Madidi Jungle Lodge after our morning trek and boated to a salt clay lick an hour away, one of our most anticipated stops for our time in Bolivia. We had gotten lucky in that our visit to Madidi overlapped with the breeding/nesting season for the red-and-green macaw colonies that call Madidi their home so we arrived at the clay lick (a huge vertical earthen wall) to find hundreds of giant macaws (as well as smaller parakeets) socializing, nesting, and feeding. We climbed a crumbling old wooden watchtower, and spent a good 60-90 minutes admiring the macaws as they swooped to and from the clay lick, soared overhead, and noisily socialized.

Later that day we returned to Rurrenebaque by boat but got one last opportunity to bird with Roberto around town where we also saw a giant caiman and a family of capybara. The next morning we set out to spend 2 nights at Sadiri Lodge, another ecolodge run by the indigenous San Jose de Uchupiamonas community but located in a different higher-altitude section of the Amazon where we hoped to see some different species. This time we were joined by two Dutch birders: Marc, a retired businessman who had recently sold his coffee import/export company and had been traveling the world photographing birds and big cats (tigers, jaguars, pumas, …), and Ferry, a designer and landscape photographer in his mid-thirties who was backpacking alone through South America for 3 months and hoped to rack up some species for his life list just like us.

_Our view from the dining lodge at Sadiri (plus a fun view of all our gear after a morning of birding)_

We spent the next 2 days birding at a number of different elevation spots around Sadiri Lodge, hunting for Bolivian endemics. Of particular interest were the antbirds and antshrikes, members of the Thamnophilidae family known for their unique behavior or following colonies of army ants around the dense jungle underbrush; as the army ants carve out paths through the forest floor they flush out other insects from their path that antbirds opportunistically feed on. Since it sits at a higher elevation in a less dense part of Madidi National Park, Sadiri Lodge typically had better birding than the denser ecolodge we’d come from and our roadside birding was frequently punctuated with “bird waves” (or “mixed flock” birding) where dozens of individual birds of multiple different species will suddenly appear in the trees all at once out of nowhere and hang around for a frantic 1-2 minutes of birding before dissapearing back into the forest. Our first encounters with bird waves were back in Fraser’s Hill, Malaysia so it was fun to get to experience this highly productive birding phenomenon again in a jungle halfway across the world.

During our week in Madidi National Park, Sara celebrated her 35<sup>th</sup> birthday! She was also pretty sick throughout our time in the jungle with a persistent cough that she actively suppressed to avoid scaring off all the birds. To her credit (and against my advice), she didn’t skip a single jungle hike because she refused to miss out on any of the Amazonian species we might see. This led us to come up with the fun title “Bronchitis and Birthday Birding in Bolivia” for this section of our trip!

La Paz (Sep 29 - Oct 2, 2025) 
======

_View of La Paz from above on the Mi Teleferico cable car system_

After a week in the Amazon, we returned to La Paz for our first real visit to this crazy city. The geography of La Paz is as stunning as it is unique; sitting at an elevation of 12,000-13,000ft, it frequently leaves first time visitors breathless from simply strolling around the city or walking up a flight of stairs. Even though we’d spent the better part of the last month at an elevation of 10,000+ feet, exploring the city and steep streets on foot was definitely a challenge but one that’s worth it because La Paz is a city unlike any other. Built into a massive bowl-like canyon, La Paz is surrounded by some of the most dramatic mountain scenery I’ve ever come across in an urban city like this and has a public cable car system (Mi Teleferico) that allows you to easily take in sprawling suburbs that crawls up the canyon sides and the stunning Andean mountains looming over the skyline.

_Market streets around El Mercado de las Brujas neighborhood we stayed in_

We stayed in a hotel in the tourist center near the Witches’ Market (El Mercado de las Brujas) and spent most of our days checking out coffee shops and wandering around the various plazas and market streets. For our first day there, we visited the National Museum of Ethnography built inside the 18<sup>th</sup> century Marquis de Villaverde Palace and dedicated to preserving and educating the public about Bolivia’s ethnic and cultural heritage. Through its exhibits, we learned about Bolivian textile traditions, the evolution of traditional Bolivian clothing and ceremonial masks, ceramics, and metalwork, and, my favorite exhibit, feather art (clothing and headdresses constructed for village chiefs in the Amazon out of the amazingly colorful feathers of some of the jungle birds we’d just spent a week searching for in Madidi). Another day we visited the National Museum of Art, Bolivia’s premier art gallery, where we spent a few hours visiting galleries spanning the 16<sup>th</sup>-18<sup>th</sup> century as well as ones showcasing modern Bolivian artists (particularly enjoyed the gallery of Alandia Pantoja’s works).

_Sara outside of the restaurant Gustu, frequently hailed as Bolivia’s top fine dining_

I wanted to take advantage of La Paz’s cheap cost-of-living to check out some of its affordable fine dining options while we were there so we made reservations at Gustu across town. Gustu (Quechuan for “flavor”) was co-founded in 2013 by the co-founder of Noma, the famous restaurant in Copenhagen which held the spot of top ranked restaurant in the world a few years ago, and is consistently ranked as Bolivia’s top restaurant. Its menu features exclusively traditional Bolivian recipes using exclusively local ingredients (adhering to its “Kilometer Zero” rule) in a fine dining setting (which at ~$40USD each makes it the most affordable fine dining restaurant we’d ever been to). 100% worth going to if you’re in La Paz - and if it’s still on the menu try the llama tartar appetizer, that was my favorite dish! For lunch another day we checked out Popular Coccina Boliviana, a famous lunch spot in La Paz founded by Gustu alumni that serves a set lunch meal and has a line out the door 30min before opening. Highly reccommend this spot as well - super affordable and exquisite presentation of modern takes on traditional Bolivian recipes.

Uyuni Salt Flats (Oct 3-5, 2025) 
======

We went back-and-forth about booking a tour through the Uyuni Salt Flats due to how touristy we’d heard it was but ultimately booked a cheap 3-day tour to visit this famous part of Bolivia since it would allow us to do a land crossing into Chile through the Atacama desert which we wanted to do anyways. While I’m glad we visited the Uyuni Salt Flats, it was my least favorite part of our time in Bolivia; but given how cheap our group tour was, I guess you get what you pay for! With that negative disclaimer done, the Uyuni Salt Flats are a pretty incredible and unique place, unlike anywhere else we’d visited on our travels.

![Uyuni-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1C9elpAhV7OArreB6fZXDP6U0RtFgsLJf&sz=w1000)
_The Uyuni Salt Flats_

We took a bus from La Paz to the town of Uyuni where we waited around at our tour office for a while unsure of what was going on. We later gathered that others in our group hadn’t shown up and since it doesn’t make financial sense for them to drive just the two of us for 3 days, they were trying to fill our vehicle with 4 more passengers before heading off. After an hour or two with no takers, they eventually pawned us off to another tour group whose vehicle only had 4 passengers (so ultimately all the research Sara had done to pick our tour company went to naught as we joined a completely different one. Oh well, the new one had slightly better ratings anyways.). We joined a group with 2 students from London in their early twenties and a couple from Australia a few years younger than us. While the group was sorta fun, our driver/guide over the next 3 days was very gruff and seemed to immediately take a dislike to the chatty Australian man (or maybe he didn’t like our last-minute addition to his group? Unclear) so the atmosphere was somewhat strained for a lot of the driving - not that it wore the affable Australian down at all. That being said, our driver/guide was knowledgeable and most importantly a safe driver (we had read horror stories of car crashes and fatalities due to speeding and alcohol consumption among drivers from some of the less reputable companies which was one reason Sara had done so much research before booking a tour).

_Obligatory shot of me and Sara with a llama taken by the train graveyard_

The classic 3-day tour through the Uyuni Salt Flats starts in the town of Uyuni and then proceeds to the “train cemetery” filled with old 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century steam locomotives sitting out in the desert, followed by a visit to Colchani Village where you learn about traditional salt processing. Since I have been collecting salt from all over the world the last ten years, I had to pick myself up some Bolivian salt to try cooking with when we move back to Canada. We then entered the world’s largest salt flat (> 10,000 square km), the Salar de Uyuni, a surreal blindingly white landscape located high on Bolivia’s 12,000ft altiplano that requires an off-road vehicle and some serious driving skills to navigate. It’s truly unlike any other landscape we’d ever visited and the novelty of the visual experience kept reverting my brain back to thinking I was standing on a snowfield instead of an immense, featureless salt flat.

_Just one of many forced perspective shots that Sara and I were dreading taking but are heavily advertised on the tour. Actually thought this one turned out sorta cool_

We lunched at a salt hotel where everything from the building to seats to tables were built entirely out of salt bricks, and then continued on to Incahuasi Island, a rocky outcropping “island” in the middle of the giant salt flat covered in ancient giant cacti. Super surreal to drive across the featureless landscape and have a cactus filled island materialize out of nowhere.

On the second day we left the salt flat and proceeded through the Bolivian altiplano desert to a number of lagunas and the site we were most excited to see on our tour: thousands and thousands of flamingos. We visited Laguna Hedionda and Laguna Colorada which are both home to flamboyance of flamingos (I looked it up and yes the correct term for a collection of flamingos is actually “flamboyance”, sometimes language is incredible). About 70% of the reason we ended up booking the Uyuni Salt Flat tour was to see these flamingos so we’re really excited to see them on Day 2 and in such huge numbers. We saw 2/3 of the species that can be spotted here: the James Flamingo and the slightly larger Andean flamingo. We were sad to miss out on the rarer Chilean flamingo but luckily managed to spot them a couple times weeks later down in Patagonia.

_Just a small fraction of the many flamingoes seen at Laguna Colorada (also known as the “Red Lagoon”); the unique red coloration of the water is due to a combination of red sediments and the proliferated of pigmented microorganisms that have adapted to the high-salinity environment of these lagoons_

For our final day of the tour, we started super early and drove up to 16,000 ft to see a cornucopia of geothermal activity: steaming mud pools, fumaroles, and active geysers littered the high altitude rocky landscape. Despite the scalding steam coming out of the cracked earth everywhere, the dawn temperatures at this altitude in the desert were somewhere south of freezing so our stop only lasted for a few minutes for some photos before we piled back into the car and continued on to the Chilean border. Along our drive, we were excited to spot some vicuñas, a species of small camelid famous for their wool which is prized even more highly than baby alpaca; legends say that the Incas valued vicuña wool more highly than gold and these days vicuña clothing and scarves sell for **outrageous** prices at high-end boutiques. We proceeded to the Chilean border and did an easy crossing to the town of San Pedro in the Atacama desert to begin our 4 weeks in Chile, the last stop on our trip to South America.
