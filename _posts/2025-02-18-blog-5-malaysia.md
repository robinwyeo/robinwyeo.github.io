2.5 weeks in Peninsular Malaysia
======

![Travel-Map](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1rkxkNTMv7fown8BWI0v_OXSpJtwvqKfM&sz=w1000)

From metropolitan cities and artsy towns to beaches and ancient rainforests, Malaysia has it all. As an added bonus, despite its small size, it contains about 8% of the world’s birds! We were unsure if Malaysia would make our travel list when we were planning our trip back in Canada but can now say in hindsight that it was 100% worth it [(Link to interactive map)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1s5GzguMHCKb7PCvZ2N6Do5Vs2J5eXlA&ehbc=2E312F).

Langkawi (Feb 1-3, 2025)
======

We didn’t originally set out to visit Langkawi but decided to stop by the island for a few nights since our last stop in Thailand (Pak Bara) was so close by. We booked our hotel right on the famous Pantai Cenang Beach so that we were only a 2min walk away from ocean sunsets each evening.

Completely by accident, we also happened to be right next to Malaysia’s largest aquarium. Since the entrance fee was only ~$15, we spent an afternoon there wandering through their marine exhibits and learning about deep sea fossils found in Malaysian waters. They also had a few penguin exhibits which, funnily enough, featured penguins on loan from the Great Plains Zoo in South Dakota!

Penang Island (Feb 4-7, 2025)
======

Since domestic flights in Malaysia were super cheap, we took a short flight south from Langkawi to Penang Island to spend a few days in George Town, the capital of Penang Province and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

_Our beautiful guesthouse in George Town (Carnarvon House)_

Despite the heat and humidity (we saw one Chinese tourist wearing a hat with solar panels powering fans built into the brim…), walking around George Town is the best way to take in its unique heritage, street art, and food scene. The street art is literally on every corner of historic old town, and the food, a combination of Chinese (nyonya), Indian, and Malay, is world-class. Sadly it wasn’t until the last day that I discovered a hole-in-the wall restaurant down the street from our guesthouse that served what I believe is the best BBQ pork in Malaysia (for the rest of our time in Malaysia, I repeatedly tried and failed to find a better one).

_George Town street art_

Due to its diverse ethnic make-up (~70% ethnic Malay, ~23% Chinese, and ~7% Indian) and colonial history, Malaysia is composed of a complicated mash of different cultures, ideologies, religions, and even architectural styles. While the majority of Malaysia is Muslim, the island of Penang is actually predominantly Chinese, making it an especially fun place to visit over Chinese New Year whose festivities were reaching a climax while we were there.

_Klan jetty on Chinese New Year in George Town_

On one of our last nights in George Town, the owner of our guesthouse told us to head to the Chinese klan jetties for Pai Ti Kong, a Hokkien celebration that takes place on the ninth day of Chinese New Year to give thanks for a prosperous year ahead. The streets were closed off and absolutely **packed** with people and street vendors. We spent a few hours there wandering through the crowds, watching the Chinese dragon dances and absolutely massive fireworks displays. Although we’d been hearing and seeing firecrackers being lit off every night since we arrived, the cacophony definitely reached a peak on Pai Ti Kong, continuously erupting all night before finally calming down around 1am (apparently the festival only officially ends once every firework has been set off).

One afternoon, we took a cab out of George Town to visit Penang Hill, a nearby attraction about ~3000ft above sea level to sea some wildlife and escape the heat of the city. To get to the top, you have to ride a funicular (apparently the steepest in Asia) for about 10min, and are rewarded with sweeping views of George Town and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve up top called The Habitat. We spent a few hours circumnavigating the trails  and skywalks in The Habitat, frequently stopping to photograph the birds, plants, and monkeys that live up there.

Another day we decided to get out of the city and visit Penang National Park, a tiny national park (Malaysia’s smallest) that’s just an hour outside of town and easily reached by cheap public transit. We first stopped by the Entopia Butterfly Garden right outside of the park entrance and ended up spending way more time than expected walking through their extensive insect collections and educational Lepidoptera exhibits.

Arriving at Penang National Park, we decided to do a 10km round-trip hike through humid jungle to Pantai Kerachut, a beach on the west side of the park. Though we didn’t see much wildlife in the jungle itself, the open area near Pantai Kerachut rewarded us with some nice close ups of a stork-billed kingfisher, a pair of pacific swallows, an oriental magpie-robin, and some soaring white-bellied sea eagles. We ran into a French couple who informed us that a troop of aggressive monkeys had blockaded the trail back to the park entrance so we teamed up with them and a group of Chinese hikers for the walk back. Thankfully the monkeys had already pushed off by the time we trekked back but safety in numbers is always a good policy when risking monkey bites!

Ipoh (Feb 7-8, 2025)
======

After a couple of packed days on Penang Island, we decided to stop by Pangkor Island to relax for a day or two; since it was directly on the way, we added a stop in the city of Ipoh to break up our transit.

_Ipoh street art_

Since most of our days were spent in transit, we really only had time to wander around Ipoh’s old town and check out some of the street art and food. The one thing we were determined to try was Ipoh White Coffee which is made by roasting coffee beans with palm oil margarine in a lighter roasting process resulting in a rich and smooth brew. Would recommend!

<br/>

Pangkor (Feb 8-9, 2025)
======

We took another bus from Ipoh (compared to the cramped buses/minivans that were common in Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, for whatever reason our Malaysian buses were always massive and extremely comfortable) then caught the local ferry from Lumut to Pangkor Island, which we’d heard was a good place to do nothing.

![10-Pangkor-Island](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1jhyh8LQKVrm9ktncBZDqs-mms6xA5pJx&sz=w1000)
_Pangkor Island_

Since it was the last weekend of Chinese New Year, the island was actually pretty packed with locals there on vacation. We spent an afternoon “island-hopping” (checking out the surrounding mini islands by boat) and snorkeling at a nearby site though the water visibility was pretty terrible. One highlight was the “hornbill feedings” - every evening, one of the hotel owners puts on hornbill feedings where visitors can give a small donation to feed the island’s hornbills pieces of banana (this is done by standing in the road and raising up a banana piece on a stick for one of the dozens of hornbills perched nearby to swoop in and grab it - check out the photo of Sara below!).

Fraser’s Hill (Feb 10-12, 2025)
======

_Birds of Fraser’s Hill_

At the last minute we decided to take a trip to Fraser’s Hill, a misty highland town in Pahang to go do some birding and retreat from the pervasive heat of Malaysia at sea-level. Although there’s not a whole lot to do in the town itself, Fraser’s Hill is an internationally renowned birding spot and even hosts an annual International Bird Race in which birding teams compete to identify the most species in a single day.

_The town of Fraser’s Hill has a very weird but charming British countryside vibe to it_

We left Pangkor Island well before dawn and boarded our ferry back to the mainland in the dark while the pre-dawn call to prayer (_Fajr_) echoed from the nearby mosque. For ~$1 we had a massive breakfast buffet in a dirty bus depot before taking the bus to Ipoh then another bus to Tanjung Malim followed by a 1.5hr taxi up the super windy road to Fraser’s Hill. Since we arrived in the early afternoon, we quickly dropped our bags at our hotel and went out birding for a few hours before sunset along Jalan Mager, Jalan Richmond, and Jalan Padang.

The next morning we were out birding by 8:30am to make the most of the productive morning birding hours. Within the first 30min we came across a trio of birders that were excitedly taking photos of the rare and endangered white-crowned hornbill that was hanging out extremely close by the side of the road (see [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-02-15-portfolio-5-malaysia) for a close-up as well as more of my favorite bird shots from Fraser’s Hill). Overall we saw 29 new species in Fraser’s Hill including some absolute favorites like the super weird dusky broadbill that I’d wanted to see for ages.

_Excited birders crowding around the white-crowned hornbill which was pretty unperturbed_

We continued birding all morning, stopping for a masalathosai lunch before hitting the trails again in the afternoon where we hiked the 5km Telekom loop looking for more birds. One fun thing about Fraser’s Hill is that virtually everyone we ran into along the roads was also a birder and generally very friendly and eager to trade tips about where to go and what interesting species they’d seen. Besides birds, we came across 4 different species of monkey/ape while there including the amazingly acrobatic siamangs, the largest species of gibbon. We ran into the same birders (mostly Malay, British, and Chinese) multiple times over our 3 days in Fraser’s Hill and in fact ran into one British birder we’d gotten to know again a few days later 200km away birding in Taman Negara National Park!

Taman Negara National Park (Feb 13-15, 2025)
======

Our next stop was Taman Negara National Park (Taman Negara literally translates to “National Park” making the official name National Park National Park) which proved to be a bit difficult/lengthy to get to - luckily we weren’t in much of a rush! We took a taxi from Fraser’s Hill to Raub then got a bus to Kuala Lipis where we stayed the night. The next morning, we took the train from Kuala Lipis to Jerantut then a taxi to the pier and a 2.5hr longboat up the Tembeling River to Kuala Taman, the town right near the entrance to Taman Negara.

_Longboat ride up the Pahang River to Taman Negara National Park_

We spent two full days in Taman Negara, usually starting early before it got too hot and hiking different loops from the park headquarters before turning in around 1pm to get lunch at one of the floating restaurants in Kuala Taman. Kuala Taman sits across the river from the national park but there are water taxis that ferry you across for 25 cents each making it pretty easy to get back and forth.

_Floating restaurants along the Pahang River_

We had initially wanted to stay overnight in one of park’s animal hides but they were all temporarily closed for maintenance so we settled for visiting the one open hide at sunset hoping to catch sight of any animals drawn to the nearby salt lick (spoiler: we saw nothing). We did see a couple new bird species like the Malayan Crested Fireback (a large, beautiful ground bird that was impossible to get a good shot of through the dense jungle brush), the Raffle’s Malkoha, the Chestnut-breasted Malkoha, and the Moustached Babbler. It was amusing talking to the more serious birders about how infuriatingly difficult it is to go jungle birding (like the Australian guy birding with his elderly mom who had spent multiple days in the jungle trying and failing to see Malaysia’s elusive Pittas) - one birding website I found amusingly referred to it as “the dubious joys of jungle birding”!

Kuala Lumpur (Feb 16-18, 2025)
======

_Central Kuala Lumpur showcasing the world’s second tallest building_

As the last stop on our trip through the Malaysian Peninsula (we also plan to go to Malaysian Borneo in a month or two), we finally visited the capital, Kuala Lumpur. As our minibus pulled into Chinatown, it suddenly started pouring marking some of the only inclement weather we’d had the entire trip (honestly a welcome relief from the stifling humidity). 

![21-Kuala-Lumpur](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1_9UplhC3e6xQBfFT3rZNdvcwwPe3PwdQ&sz=w1000)
_Petaling Street Night Market_

We stayed in a small hotel in Chinatown, a short walk away from the Petaling Night Market where we frequently strolled and tried different Chinese dishes (I was still on a mission to find BBQ pork as good as the one from George Town).

_Dinner (roast duck and pork belly with rice and bone broth soup) from Tang City Food Court by the Petaling Market_

We spent one day exploring the massive Botanical Gardens (and the excellent Taman Orchid Garden there) then wandered through the neighborhood Masjid India north of Chinatown to get some Indian food and check out the famous gold shops there. On our last day in Kuala Lumpur, we **finally** tried some durian, often called the “king of fruit” in Southeast Asia, a delicacy that’s banned from public transport and hotels due to its strong smell. We tried a small piece at Dury Dury, a durian chain, which you eat with disposable plastic gloves - can’t say we were the biggest fans but glad we tried it anyways! (Our waiter told us after that nobody really likes it the first time and that Malaysian durian was typically much stronger than durian found in other Southeast Asian countries so, who knows, maybe we’ll try it again in Thailand or Indonesia!

_Trying durian for the first time in Kuala Lumpur_

Since we were quickly approaching the halfway mark of our 6 month trip through Southeast Asia, we decided our next stop would be back up to Thailand to slow down a bit and relax on the Thai Islands and plan out the next few months. Goodbye Malaysia, we’ll be back in a month or so to visit Malaysian Borneo!
