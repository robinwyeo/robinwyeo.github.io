In search of tea and birds in Taiwan

_Travel map of 2 weeks through Taiwan_

Taiwan was a pretty late addition to our travel plans. Despite the fact that we’ve wanted to visit for ages (largely because all of my favorite teas of the last 5 years are Taiwanese oolongs), we weren’t sure if we’d have enough time on this trip to fit it in. After much deliberation, we decided to spend the last month of our trip split between Taiwan and Japan, and wow was Taiwan worth the visit. After 5 months in Southeast Asia, Taiwan was definitely a culture shock (not to mention pricier) but this little island is full of so much amazing stuff beyond its world-famous tea. I now **really, really** want to come back to do a month-long cycling trip around the whole country. Maybe one day!

Taipei (May 7-11, 2025) 
======

Our time in Taiwan’s capital Taipei was split between seeking out as many types of Taiwanese food as we could, visiting art galleries, museums and design centers, and taking advantage of the good city birding Taipei had to offer.

_For its size, Taipei was a surprisingly walkable city with good food and bubble tea everywhere_

First the food - for some reason Sara and I went into our Taiwan visit convinced that we weren’t fans of Taiwanese food. I don’t really know where this misconception originated but I’m super glad we were proved wrong because Taiwanese food is varied and incredible. We ate xialongbao at a small dumpling house right around the corner from our hotel each morning for breakfast, and usually ate dinner at night markets. Following advice from Nick Kembel’s [amazing blog](https://www.taiwanobsessed.com/) about traveling in Taiwan, we picked a different night market to visit every evening for dinner. The night markets usually pick up around sunset and are filled with open-air food stalls, electronics/trinkets/souvenir booths, and carnival games depending on which one you’re visiting. During our first few days in Taipei, we visited the Ximending Night Market, Raohe Night Market, and Shilin Night Market. Out of what we sampled, some of our favorites included pepper pies (charcoal-grilled beef+pepper filled buns), roujiamou (also called a “Chinese hamburger”, its more like marinated shredded pork in a bun), Taiwanese hot dog in a sticky rice bun, and peanut ice cream roll (ice cream in a tortilla wrap with grated peanut block dust and **cilantro** - it shouldn’t work but it weirdly does and is delicious).

One thing we’ve learned after traveling for nearly 6 months is that we tend to appreciate our experiences in a new country a lot more if we frontload a visit to a museum to better understand a country’s culture and history. Trying to put this lesson into practice, we made sure to visit the Taiwan National Palace Museum within the first couple days of visiting Taipei. This museum has the largest collection of Chinese art, culture, and history outside of China, and it is **truly enormous** (my favorite exhibits were on Chinese pottery, jade carving, and calligraphy).

We also randomly found ourselves at multiple “creative parks” during our time in Taipei - I don’t really know how to describe them effectively but they usually were full of free exhibits on design, architecture, art, and/or literature and featured all sorts of small shops selling artisanal products and art pieces (like the sort of things you’d find at a MoMA gift shop). In any case, they were usually a fun way to spend a morning or afternoon, people watching or stumbling across an unexpectedly interesting exhibit about some facet of design I’d never considered.

_Sara outside the Taipei Design Museum (as I write this I just noticed that the statues are probably a joke on the traditional Chinese guardian lions flanking the entranceway!)_

Taipei also had some surprisingly promising birding spots for such a densely populated city center (we learn this by doing background research on eBird before we visit a country - you can see what we mean for Taiwan [here](https://ebird.org/region/TW)). In particular, the Taipei Botanical Gardens were a great spot for bird photography and people watching. After nearly 6 months, I finally got a good close-up shot of a barbet! Even though their calls are ubiquitously heard all over Asia, they’re usually super difficult to see since they like to hang out in the tops of canopies and don’t move much. There were a bunch of other birders in the Botanical Gardens that morning, and (having been identified by our binoculars and telephoto lens) we were quickly alerted by a nice elderly Taiwanese birder to the nesting site of a female Malayan Night-Heron with several of her chicks - so that was a first for us! You can see my Taiwan bird photos [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-05-20-portfolio-11-taiwan). Besides the birds, I was also struck by just how active elderly Taiwanese individuals seemed to be - I saw so many runners, cardio groups, and tai-chi classes being taught there and the median age must have been in the mid-to-high 60s. Something to aspire to!

Alishan (May 11-14, 2025) 
======

_Alishan Forest (taken near the Three Sisters’ Pond)_

We took the train from Taipei to Chiayi, and transferred to the historic Alishan Forest Railway - a scenic narrow-gauge railway that was built over 100 years ago during the Japanese colonial era to log the famous cypress trees that grow there. By train it takes ~4 hours instead of ~2 to get from Chiayi to Fenqihu (the nearest railroad town to Alishan Forest) but you trade the efficiency for gorgeous scenery through the mist-covered forest as the train ascends over 7000 feet towards Alishan. If you self-identify as a ferroequinologist (a fun word for “train enthusiast”), it’s definitely worth checking out in Taiwan.

For our first night, we booked a hotel right outside the park headquarters so we could get up at dawn and go birding (though we stayed in nearby Fenqihu for the next two nights since hotels were half the price there). We tried to set ourselves up for good birding by being onsite at dawn but unfortunately we can’t control the weather, and it was rainy off/on our entire first day in Alishan. Surprisingly enough, the birds seemed only mildly perturbed, and over the course of 5 hours of exploring Alishan Forest we ended up seeing a decent number of new (very wet) endemic species, including the endemic Formosan rock macaque!

Regardless of how we spent our first morning in Alishan, it’s not world-famous for its birds but rather as one of the top places in the world for cultivating a type of tea called high-mountain oolong. Quick primer/tangent on tea: all true tea comes from the same species of plant (_Camellia sinensis_) and whether it’s called green tea, oolong tea, or black tea depends on the level of oxidation: green tea is unoxidized, oolong tea is partially oxidized (usually 10-40%), and black tea is fully oxidized (note: this is a bit of an oversimplification since I left out a variety of other factors involved in tea processing but that’s the basic idea). When _Camellia sinensis_ is cultivated at higher elevations (and in the right climate), the flavor-producing compounds in the leaves become more concentrated, resulting in a stronger and often more interesting flavor. As a result, high-mountain oolongs have become especially famous over the last few decades with price usually scaling with the altitude of the tea farm. “Alishan High Mountain Oolong” refers to anything grown over 1000m but the most expensive Alishan oolongs are generally those grown around 1700m; teas that are grown at even higher elevations (like Lishan or Dayulin where cultivation takes place above 2000m) tend to scale even higher in price, with the prize-winning high mountain teas of Dayulin going for astronomically expensive rates. Tangent on tea over.

_A tea farm we passed by one day walking to a bus stop in a nearby town outside of the Alishan Forest_

Moving from birding to the important matter of tea purchases, as soon as we took the bus from Alishan to Fenqihu for our next two nights, we set out to find a place to do a tea tasting. This proved to not be very difficult as our hotel was **literally** wedged between two tea shops that both offered tastings. This actually wasn’t much of a coincidence since we’d already gotten good intel from our friends Rob and Ubin (Rob is perhaps the only person I know who likes Taiwanese oolongs more than me) that Fenqihu was the place to buy Alishan oolongs (you can technically find them all over Taiwan but the prices vary wildly, and, outside Alishan, it’s difficult to ensure that they’re not counterfeit). Over our two days in Fenqihu, we stopped by different shops for a total of 3 tea tastings where we sampled 2-5 different teas each time (almost all of these were oolongs, just grown at different elevations and with different processing techniques which vary the level of oxidation and roasting).

_Our second tea tasting in Fenqihu: the shop owner spoke zero English but it’s amazing how effective Google Translate can be_

Even though we stayed in Fenqihu, we still took the 45min bus the next two mornings back to Alishan so we could explore more of the forest and go hiking. The most memorable hike was up to the summit of Datashan (~8000ft) - most of it was through misty mountainous forest which reminded us both of the Pacific Northwest. At the summit, we were greeted by an extremely photogenic white-whiskered laughingthrush that was so used to humans he hopped on my shoe to get better access to snacks that hikers had dropped.

The railroad town of Fenqihu is itself surrounded by extensive bamboo forests that have a number of good trails that we’d hike when we were back from Alishan and overcaffeinated from tea tastings. We’d read that, during the evenings, certain segments of these bamboo forests become lit up by hundreds of fireflies. The first night we tried to find the firefly groves, we ended up getting a bit lost and took a roundabout way there, seeing max ~5 fireflies in 30min and thought “Surely this must just be an overblown thing from the internet”. All of a sudden, we rounded a corner on the trail and stumbled across a firefly garden that was illuminated by **hundreds and hundreds of fireflies**. We came back both nights we spent in Fenqihu to walk along the forest road by the firefly gardens. Such an unbelievable experience.

Tainan (May 14-16, 2025) 
======

From Alishan, we decided to continue south by train to Tainan, Taiwan’s oldest and most culturally important city. Since Tainan contains more temples than any other city in Taiwan (an impressive stat considering just how many temples seem to be everywhere in Taiwan), we spent a lot of our time there wandering around neighborhoods and stopping to admire the various temples. We went out of our way to visit the first Confuscius Temple in Taiwan; due to a tradition started hundreds of years ago, the temple contains 16 giant plaques with inscriptions honoring Confuscius’ teachings written by the leaders of Taiwan over the centuries (from the Qing Emperors up through the modern day democratic leaders).

We also visited the Taiwan Museum of Literature, a surprisingly excellent and interesting free museum covering the history and evolution of Taiwan’s writing traditions (especially in the context of their relationship with China and the West). Tainan is also famous for its food so we (of course) sought out its rotating night markets for dinner. Tainan has several giant night markets that are each open on a different day of the week; we got lucky and happened to be spending a night there when its largest and most historic Garden Night Market was open. Dinner was Taiwan BBQ corn, deep fried pork, and, for desert, a soufflé pancake covered in a boba-filled syrup (seriously, the soufflé pancakes were so good in Taiwan).

For our last morning in Tainan, we took a bus out west to Anping where we visited some of the oldest temples in Taiwan and stopped by a few museums, like the surprisingly interesting (and esoteric) Anping Oyster Lime Kiln Cultural Center which contained exhibits on the myriad uses of oyster shells (the principal of which is extracting lime). We also stopped by the historic Tait & Co Merchant House Museum to see a preserved mercantile house used by Europeans during the early days of Taiwanese trade with the West; behind the historic building is an old warehouse that has become completely overrun and entwined with the living roots and branches of a giant banyan tree.

Taipei (May 16-20, 2025) 
======

For our last few days in Taiwan, we returned to Taipei, and used it as a home base to do some day trips out of the city. Since Taiwan is so small, there are a bunch of cool places to visit within 1-2 hours from its capital! We started with an early morning trip up to Yangmingshan National Park which was accessible by bus in <1hr from where we were staying in Taipei. We stopped by Qiangshan Park and Menghuan Lake to look for some more endemic birds and then do a hike up to the nearby Menghuan summit.

_Hiking around Yangmingshan National Park_

We returned to Taipei from the national park around lunchtime, and then headed to the eastern part of the city to ride a scenic gondola up to Maokong, a famous tea-growing region in the hills right outside of Taipei. Unfortunately, it started raining and thundering as we arrived to the gondola so it was temporarily shut down, and we had to take a bus up to Maokong (though we got to ride it back down a few hours later once the rain had stopped). The bad weather also meant that the famous panoramic views of Taipei from the hills of Maokong were shrouded in rain but what was lost in visibility was made up for in misty atmosphere so it still made for some fun views.

_Gondola ride back down from Maokong once the rain stopped_

Of course, the real reason to visit Maokong was to sample some more tea - specifically, Tieguanyin and Bhaozhong, two teas the Maokong region is famous for growing. Even though they’re both oolongs, they’re really nothing like the high-mountain oolongs we were drinking down in Alishan (and in fact, Bhaozhong is much closer to a green tea). We walked around Maokong in the rain until we found a small tea shop that offered tea tastings, and spent a really fun hour tasting different Maokong teas. It was a family-run operation where the son (who was probably our age) led the tea tastings since he spoke great English, and his father handled the processing of all of their teas (some of them nationally award-winning!) which they sourced from nearby farms in Maokong.

_Tea tasting up in Maokong_

On the recommendations of our friends Rob and Ubin, we decided to spend our last full day doing a daytrip out to Jiufen, an extremely picturesque (and touristy) little town about 1.5 hours east of Taipei by bus. To avoid the crowds, we caught an early morning bus out there, and got to Jiufen before its famous Old Street had opened.

_The famous Old Street in Jiufen_

Our main reason for visiting (besides soaking in the panoramic views of the Pacific) was to visit one of the famous traditional teahouses that Jiufen is famous for. Unlike the tea tastings we’d done so far (which are free and conducted by the owner of a tea shop under the expectation that you’ll buy some tea in bulk to take home), at the teahouses in Jiufen you essentially rent a table and the use of their traditional tea equipmentent, pick a tea type and some snacks, and then spend several hours brewing and re-brewing teapots for yourself (the Taiwanese way!). We drank 3 pots of Alishan high-mountain oolong, each re-brewed 8 times and served each other in miniscule cups while tasting traditional Taiwanese snacks (the correct way to prepare and serve oolong in Taiwan is a whole process which is very fun but also a bit involved so brewing and drinking tea for a few hours is almost a full-time activity).

_Photo Sara took of me drinking tea and taking in the views from Amei Teahouse_

Fun fact about Amei Teahouse where we spent our morning: for some reason, there’s a persistent rumor that it was the inspiration for the bathhouse in Miyazaki’s film Spirited Away because the buildings look very similar; despite being confirmed by Miyazaki himself that this isn’t true, it hasn’t stopped all of the tourist shops on Jiufen’s Old Street from capitalizing on the rumor and selling all sorts of Spirited Away trinkets!

_Amei Teahouse where we spent 2 relaxing hours traditionally preparing and consuming Taiwanese oolong_

Highly caffeinated from our 3 hours of continuously drinking >20(!) cups of tea, we found a small dim sum restaurant off of Jiufen Old Street then took public transit back to Taipei. Sara had a doctor’s appointment across the city from where we were staying and we decided to spend the whole afternoon wandering back to our hotel and exploring the new neighborhoods and temples we passed along the way. For our last night in Taiwan, we got Taiwan Beef Noodle Soup (recommended by Sara’s old co-worker Sam who actually started a company ([Bang Tea](https://www.bang-tea.com/)) sourcing high quality Tawainese oolongs) followed by mango shaved ice from our favorite spot in Ximending (they somehow manage to perfectly replicate the texture of snow for this famous Taiwanese desert, highly recommend trying a shaved ice desert if you’re in Taiwan).

After two weeks, we had to say goodbye to Taiwan so we packed up our stuff which now included lugging around one extra suitcase containing souvenirs and gifts. Sadly this meant thatwe were no longer the (relatively) unencumbered backpackers we’d been for the last 5 months. Although we were expecting to like Taiwan (at the very least because of the tea), we were both surprised by just how much we **loved** Taiwan and found ourselves wishing that we’d budgeted more time than just two weeks to explore this wonderful island. Oh well, I’m sure we’ll be back sometime soon!
