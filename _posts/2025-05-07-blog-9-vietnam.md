3 weeks in North Vietnam
======

Coming from Raja Ampat, we found ourselves much closer to Australia than to mainland Asia. To get up to Vietnam, we first had to fly across all of Indonesia up to Bali and then catch another flight to North Vietnam, and it turned out the only cheap flights had a 6 hour layover in Denpasar, Bali’s capital. Luckily, Bali is so compact that the Denpasar airport is basically right in town; so, instead of spending our long layover in the airport, we grabbed our bags and caught a Grab 10min away to a Balinese restaurant on a peaceful koi-filled lake right off the main road. Not a bad way to spend a layover!

Since we only had 3 weeks in Vietnam, we decided that we wouldn’t attempt to visit the whole country this trip, and restricted ourselves instead to North Vietnam, flying in/out of Hanoi. We ended up spending our time there exploring the limestone karst landscapes by motorbike, sampling amazing street food, and searching in vain for birds in the jungly national parks. Excited to return in the future and check out South Vietnam next!

Hanoi (April 17-22, 2025) 
======

Coming off of 2 weeks of diving and birding in Raja Ampat followed by ~10 hours of flying, we found ourselves pretty exhausted when we arrived at 11pm in Hanoi, so we decided to give ourselves a couple extra days there to relax without much on the agenda besides trying Vietnamese street food (something Sara and I were both super excited about). We stayed in a nice (and relatively cheap!) 3-star hotel in the Old Quarter of Hanoi, around Hoan Kiem Lake. Dating back over 1000 years, the Old Quarter was originally composed of a maze of 36 streets organized such that each street specialized in a particular artisanal trade; to this day, you can still get tailored silk suits on “Silk Street” (“Hàng Gai”) and custom silver jewelry on “Silver Street” (“Hàng Bạc”)!

Besides being one of the best places for shopping in Hanoi, the Old Quarter is famous for its street food; its chaotic narrow streets are crowded by food stalls, usually specializing in a single dish that they serve to you on the street seated down on mini plastic stools that always made me feel like a giant in a kindergarten classroom. But the street food was probably the single thing Sara and I were most excited about checking out in Hanoi, and it did not disappoint. I made it my mission to have a different _banh mi_ every day (**so good** and each usually only cost ~$1-1.5 USD). Our other favorites were egg coffee (Vietnamese coffee topped with whipped egg yolk and sugar), _pho bo_ (beef pho, usually served for breakfast), _bun cha_ (grilled pork and pork patties served in a rich, sweet dipping broth), and _banh ghoi_ (deep fried pastries filled with pork, vermicelli, and mushroom). The combination of amazing street food, beautiful French colonial architecture, and fun chaotic energy ended up making Hanoi one of our favorite cities of the trip.

Finally being back in a big city after two weeks in remote West Papua, we had to devote some of our time in Hanoi to running errands. For one, the Canadian federal election was coming up and I had arranged (from Indonesia) for a special ballot to be sent to the Canadian Consulate in Hanoi so our first afternoon was spent ferrying me across the city to vote. I also desperately needed a haircut which I got for $3 USD down the street from our hotel, and Sara and I each visited the dentist to get our bi-annual tooth cleaning visit taken care of for $8 (really makes you wonder why dental care is so exorbitantly expensive in the US and Canada…).

One day, we visited Ngọc Sơn Temple (“Temple of the Jade Mountain”), a sacred spiritual site on a small island within Hoan Kiem Lake, built in the 19<sup>th</sup> century to honor a Vietnamese warrior for defeating the Mongols back in the 13<sup>th</sup> century. The temple also houses two giant preserved turtles that once lived in Hoan Kiem Lake displayed in glass cases. These turtles hold special spiritual and cultural significance in Vietnam as they are said to be related to the magical turtle of Vietnamese folklore that surfaced from the lake to bestow a mythical sword to Emperor Lê Lợi to help him lead his armies to victory over invaders.

We also spent an afternoon visiting the Temple of Literature, an important cultural site built in 1070 (and dedicated to Confucius) which eventually became Vietnam’s first national university. Unfortunately our visit there was interrupted by bad weather - it abruptly got dark despite being 2pm and then poured on us as we waited out the rain under the temple awnings. On our last day in Hanoi, we visited the Vietnamese Women’s Museum - the most interesting exhibit was on the role of women during the Vietnamese War, assisting and often participating directly in the war effort (definitely worth a visit if you’re in Hanoi!).

Ninh Binh (April 22-24, 2025) 
======

We next took a minibus to Ninh Binh, a gorgeous rural province 2 hours south of Hanoi covered in green rice fields and dramatic limestone karsts. It’s a tough contest but Ninh Binh was probably the prettiest stop during our 3 weeks in Vietnam and one of the most beautiful stays of our whole trip.

_We saw a group of about 20 water buffaloes cooling off in the stream as we biked around_

The next morning we rented bicycles from our guesthouse and biked to the [Trang An Scenic Landscape Complex](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1438/), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, to go on a 2 hour boat ride along the quietly flowing rivers and through the caves that cut through the towering limestone karsts that define the region. Along the way we stopped at a handful of temples to go on short 5 minute walks but for the most part we just sat back and enjoyed the passing scenery as our boatwoman rowed us along (also - it’s seriously so impressive how these older Vietnamese ladies row tourists on these small wooden boats **all…day…long**).

The next day, we took a 45min Grab up to do another boat tour at the [Van Long Wetland Reserve](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/vietnam/ninh-binh-province/attractions/van-long-nature-reserve/a/poi-sig/1142986/1325758), an important wetland bird habitat and one of the last places you can see the [Delacour’s langur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delacour%27s_langur), a critically endangered species with only ~200 individuals left in the wild. We spent nearly 3 hours getting peacefully rowed around the wetland surrounded by limestone karsts, spotting a large family of the endangered monkeys, tons of Asian openbills, and a delightfully colorful gray-headed swamphen (see [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-05-07-portfolio-10-vietnam) for bird shots from this trip).

Cuc Phuong National Park (April 25-26, 2025) 
======

Our next stop was to visit Cuc Phuong National Park, one of the most important birding spots in North Vietnam. To maximize our early morning time in the national park, we had booked 2 nights at the park substation 20km deep into the park from the visitor center (the park website refers to it as “about the furthest you can get from civilization” which I think is a bit of an exaggeration after visiting places like Danum Valley (Borneo) and Waigeo (Raja Ampat) but it was _pretty_ remote and lacked hot water+electricity, unquestionably a defining characteristic of our remote stays).

Since we didn’t have a car, we had to rent a motorbike to get from the visitor center to the park center substation 20km away which presented us with a challenge given there were 2 of us and we both had daypacks as well as 40L backpacks. In the end, I ferried Sara and her bags to our lodging and then motorbiked back alone to pick up the remaining bags before turning around and heading back up; the whole thing took over 2 hours (instead of ~40min) but motorbiking through the park deep in the forest with almost no one else on the road actually ended up being one of my favorite parts of the Cuc Phuong visit - also, by the time we left, I was comfortable enough on the motorbike to take Sara and myself along with all our bags back in one trip, so that’s improvement!

We were super excited to get to spend 2 early mornings in Cuc Phuong to go birding but it ended up lightly raining off/on for our entire time there so our birding trips were **abysmal**, especially considering the eBird hotspot for Cuc Phuong is among the best in Vietnam. Although we often heard all sorts of birds, the rainy weather and deep jungle brush combined to keep them out of sight. The only exception was actually a super exciting one - while we were hiking along a jungle trail to see one of the park’s “ancient trees”, I spotted a bright green ball of feathers right off the trail that we confirmed by its call to be a [bar-bellied pitta](https://ebird.org/species/babpit1#:~:text=Identification&text=Jade%2Dgreen%20pitta%20with%20densely,has%20a%20pale%20orangish%20head.)! Since I’d become mildly obsessed with seeing pittas over the past couple months, I was super happy to log this sighting even if it was my **only** new lifer during our 3 days at Cuc Phuong national park. As for the food - similar to our previous overnight stays at national parks in Borneo, it was unfortunately both pricey and aggressively mediocre but this was made up for by the two peacocks that lived by the park center restaurant and were seen strutting around all day long (including right outside of our lodging up the road!).

While the birding may have been a major letdown, there were thousands and thousands of butterflies all over the park who seemed much less deterred by the rainy weather than the birds. We spent our days motorbiking up and down the main park road, stopping whenever we saw congregations of butterflies, and for hikes into the jungle (our favorite was to visit the [“Cave of Prehistoric Man”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Moong_Cave), an important archeologic site dating back 7500 years).

Phong Nha – Kẻ Bàng National Park (April 27 - May 4, 2025) 
======

After a short 1 night stopover in the city of Vinh to split up 10hrs of train travel, we arrived at our next stop, Phong Nha – Kẻ Bàng National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site about 400km south from Cuc Phuong. Phong Na National Park is composed of limestone mountains riddled with hundreds of ancient caves, many containing gorgeous geological formations, and even some massive enough to contain their own microclimates. Seriously, if you like caves, this is the place for your next vacation! (Note: I say that as a reluctant caver - out of the two of us, Sara’s the one who’s really passionate about geology and caves but I’ll admit they’ve been growing on me over the years).

I was glad I’d gotten used to motorbiking around by this point because it was pretty much required to get around Phong Na NP without signing up for a guided tour group. Every other business rents motorbikes so we rented ourselves one for our time there and were thus able to travel independently to visit birding spots and caves. Honestly, Phong Na is almost worth a visit just to motorbike around and take in the stunning vistas from the road through the national park.

On our first day there, we left our hotel at 6:30am and motorbiked 30min to [Paradise Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thi%C3%AAn_%C4%90%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dng_Cave), getting there right before opening (I think there were literally only two other groups there before us). The 2km trail up to the cave was supposedly a good birding site but we were once again foiled by light rain and didn’t see anything interesting. That being said, Paradise Cave might just be the coolest cave I’ve ever visited. It is absolutely **massive** and we spent an hour walking along the boardwalk through cavern after cavern covered with unbelievably diverse geological formations (also, since we were nearly the first ones there, most of the time we were alone which was especially cool in a cave that size). Despite how huge it seemed to us, we learned that visitors are only allowed access to the first kilometer out of the 30km that’s been mapped of the cave system which means that we saw barely 3% of it! So crazy.

_The unbelievable geological formations in Paradise Cave! I have about a hundred photos of weird geology from that cave, it was difficult to pick a picture_

For the next two days, we joined the 2D/1N Hang Pygmy Exploration overnight caving trip with a company called Jungle Boss to explore Pygmy Cave, the fourth largest cave in the world (trip link [here](https://junglebosstours.com/tour/hang-pygmy-exploration-2d1n)). We were grouped up with 3 Italian friends, a Brazilian traveler, and a retired Korean businessman (weirdly, all men on this trip besides Sara), along with our guide Hoan and about as many porters as there were clients who went ahead of us to set up our overnight camp in Pygmy Cave.

_Our group during the 2D/1N caving trip to Hang Pygmy_

We set off in the late morning and spent the first couple hours trekking through the jungle to get to Hang Over (“Hang” means “Cave” in Vietnamese) where we then put on helmets and headlamps and hiked the next 2.5hrs with no natural light through the first cave system. We emerged from Hang Over for a short trek through the jungle before approaching its sister cave, Hang Pygmy. It’s really difficult to describe just how big these caves were (and all sense of scale gets washed out of the pictures we took) but they somehow made Paradise Cave seem pretty small.

_Trying to capture the scale of Hang Pygmy which our guide Hoan told us gets its name because as you walk into it you look smaller and smaller_

After about 20min hiking into the mouth of Hang Pygmy, we put on harnesses, clipped ourselves in, and did a 300m _via ferrata_ along a tricky section with a giant drop off on either side, followed by a 10m abseil down a cliff face deeper into the cave. We took a swim in an underground lake with headlamps on to wash up a bit (water was cold but actually a bit warmer than the water in the San Francisco Bay) then arrived at the camp the Jungle Boss porters had set up for us in the massive cavern of Hang Pygmy.

_Our overnight set-up by the mouth of Hang Pygmy’s exit. Every evening and morning this area was swarming with cave swifts_

We camped overnight in tents there alongside about a million cave swifts and set out the next morning to hike out the 10km back to the road and head back to town. One super surprising part about this cave trip was how unbelievably good the food was that our porters prepared out there in the cave. They set up a fully-assembled kitchen in Hang Pygmy and served us a dinner with about 6 different dishes that were up there among some of our favorite Vietnamese food of the entire trip.

For our last two days in Phong Na, we rented another motorbike, and explored the rice fields and trails of Bong Loi Valley just 20km down the road from town. We also visited the Phong Na Botanical Garden to hike up Gio Waterfall and try to see some cool birds (once again unsuccessfully - the only real letdown of our time in Vietnam was the super unproductive birding…). Our last day in the area was spent in the city of Dong Hoi 45min towards the coast from the national park where we explored the city before catching the 12hr overnight sleeper train back up to Hanoi.

Hanoi (May 5-7, 2025) 
======

After a full week down by the Phong Na National Park, we were excited to be back in the bustling city of Hanoi. We took advantage of our last two days there to take care of a bunch of shopping we hadn’t gotten around to on our first visit and to get Sara all of the fruit she’d been craving down in the cave (especially the mangosteens!). Before we left Vietnam, we wanted to see a traditional [Vietnamese water puppet show](https://thanglongwaterpuppet.com/) which had all been booked up when we were there two weeks prior. Water puppet shows are a traditional form of Vietnamese folk performance that originated in the rural rice fields over 1000 years ago where hand-carved wooden puppets are used to show scenes of rural life and act out traditional folk stories over water accompanied by live music. Definitely worth a visit if you’re visiting Hanoi!

Besides the regrettably unproductive birding, we had such an awesome time in North Vietnam which might just be the prettiest country we’ve visited on our travels. Next up, we’re in for some culture shock as we say goodbye to Southeast Asia and head up to Taiwan and then Japan!
