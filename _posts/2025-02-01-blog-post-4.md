Northern Thailand down to the Malaysian border
======

Three and a half weeks in Thailand! Most of our time was concentrated in the North near Chiang Mai before the long drive down to Bangkok via Sukothai followed by an overnight train down to the border for our next destination: Malaysia.

Chiang Rai (Jan 8-9, 2025)
======

After a 3 day journey along the Mekong River up through Northern Laos, we crossed the border into Thailand with a group of other backpackers on Jan 8<sup>th</sup> and found ourselves a hostel in the border town of Chiang Khong. It was late enough that real restaurants were closed but luckily we were across the street from a 24hr 7-eleven which in Thailand have a huge selection of decent prepared food options. As we’d learn over the next couple weeks, 7-elevens in Thailand are weirdly amazing in general and always packed with a thousand people. The next morning we caught the local bus to Chiang Rai so that we could visit Wat Rong Khun (“The White Temple”).

_Wat Rong Khun (“The White Temple”)_

Unlike the other wats we’d visited so far on our trip, Wat Rong Khun isn’t actually a traditional Buddhist temple but is actually a relatively modern creation by Thai artist [Chalermchai Kositpipat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalermchai_Kositpipat). Extremely impressive and equally strange, this surreal temple blends traditional Buddhist elements with pop culture and social critique embedded into its architectural design and extensive interior murals. Unsurprisingly it was both pretty touristy and crowded but we still thought it was worth the visit (there’s also a ton to see there beyond the main temple - the attached art gallery of Chalermchai Kositpipat‘s oil paintings and sculptures alone was worth visiting).

Chiang Dao (Jan 10-12, 2025)
======

_Hiking to Wat Tham Pha Plong in Chiang Dao Wildlife Sanctuary_
<br/>

Since Thailand is a pretty notable destination in Southeast Asia for birders, we were easily able to find online resources for birding hotspots across the country, and decided to visit the protected forests in Chiang Dao Wildlife Sanctuary before making our way to Chiang Mai, the largest city in Northern Thailand.


![Chiang-Dao-2](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1y-daOQgZ1o4dYduR7c9Cp1MI9RPOlnVP&sz=w1000)
_Malee’s Nature Lovers Bungalows_
<br/>

Following advice from [www.thaibirding.com](www.thaibirding.com), we booked 3 nights in a bungalow at [Malee’s Nature Lovers Bungalows](http://www.maleenature.com/) situated just outside of the town of Chiang Dao within walking distance to the entrance of the nature preserve. Run by an older couple, Malee and Kurt, we were greeted with the immediate question “Are you here to see the birds?” so we knew we we’re in the right place! In addition to good birding, Malee’s had one of the most impressive orchid gardens we’d ever seen as well as some of our favorite accommodations so far (will definitely be coming back here if/when we re-visit Northern Thailand). For the next 2 days, we got up at sunrise to have breakfast at Malee’s then walked the short distance to the temple steps up to Wat Tham Pha Plong where we’d bird at several sites all morning before turning in for lunch and to relax (if you find photo curation relaxing…) at Malee’s.

_Sunrise birding in the early morning fog_
<br/>

Although we were sad to leave Malee’s (seriously would have been happy spending a week there), the other notable birding spot in the area was in the rice fields on the other side of town so we booked one night at a new hostel about 15km from the nature preserve.

![Chiang-Dao-4](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=18kzJyVr6wKU_M9gkuM75R1TO51dkCBWu&sz=w1000)
_Chiang Dao rice paddies_
<br/>

We figured out a nice 5km loop around the rice paddies and grass fields outside of town so we birded there at sunset and again the next morning at sunrise. Our sunrise walk actually got chilly enough that Sara and I had to wear all of our (admittedly few) warm layers we’d brought for our travels for the first couple hours. Worth it though as we identified about 35 species of birds (one of our highest counts for a single site without a professional guide). Sadly, our new accommodation was right next to an ongoing development project so our time there was depressingly filled with watching bulldozers crate in mounds of dirt to fill in and destroy the same sort of agricultural field that just a kilometer away was so evidently biodiverse.

<br/>
<br/>


Chiang Mai (Jan 13-15, 2025)
======

After a 3 hour local bus from Chiang Dao, we arrived in Chiang Mai, the largest city in Northern Thailand and the capital of Chiang Mai province. As we’d learn at a number of museums and temples over the next week, Chiang Mai was originally founded in 1296 as the capital of the Lanna Kingdom which ruled Northern Thailand from the 13<sup>th</sup> to 18<sup>th</sup> century before the rise of Siam (and present-day Thailand). As a consequence of its rich history, Chiang Mai is home to a whopping 300+ temples and has in recent years become a popular destination for expats and digital nomads working remotely in Thailand.

_Sara walking through the Chiang Mai Night Bazaar_
<br/>

We booked a room in a hostel in the East part of the city near the Ping River since it put us within walking distance of the Night Bazaar which we were excited to check out. Every evening around sunset, the streets in this neighborhood of Chiang Mai transform into an extensive interconnected night market selling paintings, clothing, touristy trinkets, carvings, etc as well as an enormous array of street food stalls (the real reason we wanted to stay nearby).

_Street food stalls at Chiang Mai Night Bazaar_
<br/>

Since we arrived in Chiang Mai in the late afternoon, we didn’t have time to do much besides drop our bags and head to the Night Bazaar for dinner. On our first night we sampled 7 different street food stalls: mochi, gyoza, Khao soi, chicken satay, chicken pad thai, Thai crispy pancakes, and mango sticky rice (a helpful thing about traveling as a couple is you get to rationalize ordering twice as many dishes and just splitting them all). The standout here (besides mango sticky rice which we ate daily) was Khao soi, an egg noodle curry soup which is a specialty of Northern Thailand (it’s relatively unknown outside of the country as most North American Thai food gets its major influences from Southern Thai cooking).

_Ho Trai Library bridge lined with nagas at Wat Chiang Man_
<br/>

Besides its reputation for great Northern Thai food, Chiang Mai boasts a huge number of historic temples so we spent a good amount of time bouncing between them across the city (e.g. Wat Panping, Wat Chiang Man, Wat Lok Moli) and learning about their history. Since Sara has a particular love for nagas (pictured above), we went out of our way to find our favorite naga statues and find similarities/differences to those at the wats in Laos and Cambodia.

<br/>

On Jan 15<sup>th</sup>, we visited the Chiang Mai National Museum to learn more about the history of Northern Thailand and the Lanna Kingdom. Although the museum had a large collection of interesting Buddhist sculptures and artifacts, its confusing layout and terribly translated informational legends made learning about the Lanna Kingdom difficult (had a much better experience at the Chiang Mai Cultural Center a few days later). Probably our only negative museum visit on our trip so far so it was bound to happen sometime! To not get too burnt out on temples and museums, we found a secluded jungly cafe off of a main road near our hostel where we spent our afternoons writing and reading (and watching the three random giant tortoises that ambled around the cafe).

<br/>


Doi Inthanon (Jan 16-18, 2025)
======

<br/>

One of the main reasons we wanted to visit Chiang Mai was its proximity to some of northern Thailand’s protected forests at Chiang Dao, Doi Suthet, and especially Doi Inthanon. Doi Inthanon National Park, often referred to as the “Roof of Thailand”, contains the country’s highest peak (2565m/8415ft) and is the top birding spot in Thailand in terms of biodiversity.

<br/>

Back in Chiang Dao, Malee had recommended we stay at Rangbondoi (also called “Mountain’s Nest”) when we visited Doi Inthanon. Randbondoi is run by Bantoom and his wife Nee, an indigenous [Karen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people) couple from one of the mountain villages, who have built a couple bungalows and 3 bird photography blinds on their property. Similar to Malee’s, for the last 20 years, their business has catered to international birders who visit to see the national park’s impressive ornithological biodiversity (487 species recorded). To get there from Chiang Mai, we caught a public songtaew from the city’s southern gate to the town bordering the edge of the national park then another to the small village near Rangbondoi partway up the mountain. We arrived in late afternoon so luckily had a couple hours of remaining daylight to check out one of the bird blinds and get some close-up shots of the blue whistling-thrush and rufous-bellied niltava.

_Sara and Bantoom birding in the forest at Doi Inthanon_
<br/>

The next morning we hired Bantoom to be our birding guide for the day so we set off right after sunrise and spent the day visiting about a half dozen birding spots in the national park, ultimately seeing 53 new species in a single day (one of the best single-day totals so far!). Some of our favorites were the Pygmy Cupwing, Mrs. Gould’s Sunbird, Silver-eared Laughingthrush, multiple species of Niltava, Orange-bellied Leafbird, White-rumped Shama, and the rare endemic Green-tailed Sunbird at the summit (I got decent shots of a couple of these birds which you can find [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-01-31-portfolio-4-thailand/)). Since Doi Inthanon is a world-class destination for birding we’d occasionally run into other birders, many with lenses so large their owner struggled to carry them (making our compact entry-level telephoto lenses look puny in comparison)  - an amusing reminder of how much more seriously some others take birding!

_Agricultural fields in Doi Inthanon down the road from Rangbondoi_
<br/>

We spent our downtime curating our bird lists and trying to figure out some of the harder IDs by cross-referencing photos with bird identification books and historic eBird ID lists from the area, as well as visiting the nearby Karen village and trying Northern Thai dishes. It was interesting to hear Bantoom (who’d lived there for 50 years) describe how the mountain’s agricultural practices had changed over his lifetime - from poppy production to strawberry and chrysanthemums - a process driven by the protected status of the national park and directly facilitated by the late and deeply revered [Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhumibol_Adulyadej).

_Our visit to Wat Phra Singh_
<br/>

After one last sunrise morning (and another ~1500 photos) at Rangbondoi’s bird blinds, we hired one of Bantoom’s neighbors to drive us back to the town bordering the national park where we jumped on a cheap public songtaew back to Chiang Mai. We decided to stay in the same neighborhood by the night bazaar and booked a couple nights in a “minitel” that weirdly enough reminded us of San Francisco’s tech co-working spaces. We spent the next day exploring Chiang Mai’s “Old City”, a UNESCO World Heritage listed site, and started with Wat Phra Singh.

<br/>

Built in 1345, Wat Phra Singh is a sprawling temple complex with multiple beautifully constructed buildings, each housing enough Buddhist iconography and murals to fill a small museum. Of note, Wat Phra Singh was originally built to house Northern Thailand’s most revered Buddha statue, Phra Phuttha Sihing (ironically not any of the many Buddha statues in the above photo).

_Largest stupa in Chiang Mai at Wat Chedi Luang_
<br/>

In order to better contextualize the wats we were visiting, we spent the rest of our morning in the excellent [Chiang Mai Cultural Center](https://cmocity.com/chiang-mai-art-cultural-centre/), a museum exploring the culture and history of Northern Thailand and the influence of the Lanna Kingdom (seriously such a better museum than the Chiang Mai National Museum we previously visited…). We next walked across the Old City to Wat Phan Tao and then Wat Chedi Luang, a 14<sup>th</sup> century wat famous for being the site of Chiang Mai’s city pillar as well as Chiang Mai’s largest stupa (282 feet high and 144 feet wide).

_Textiles from different indigenous groups across Thailand and Southeast Asia in a permanent collection at Kalm Village_
<br/>

Tired of being on our feet exploring temples all day, we walked to [Kalm Village](https://www.kalmvillage.com/), a combination maker space and free art/design gallery (and one of my favorite stops in Chiang Mai). After relaxing for an hour or two with our books and coffee, we explored the many exhibits at Kalm Village which explore ancestral North Thai tribal craftsmanship. Especially cool was the Kalm Archive which showcases prime examples of textiles from different tribal traditions in Thailand and larger Southeast Asia (not something I was ever particularly interested in but it was pretty fun to watch Sara geek out about how impressive+difficult some of the traditional textile techniques are).

![Chiang-Mai-Pt2-5](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Wrm0ceGJwdb3NZkKN85MsTMEnrQfLX3Z&sz=w1000)
_Wat Phra That Doi Suthep_
<br/>

For our final day in Chiang Mai, we grabbed a series of songtaews to get us up to Doi Suthep, a national park less than an hour west of Chiang Mai. The national park’s main attraction is Wat Phra That Doi Suthep; legend has it that this mountain wat was constructed in the Doi Suthep forest at the spot where a white elephant carrying Gautama Buddha’s shoulder bone dropped dead after trumpeting three times signaling the site as sacred. The wat itself is beautifully ornate and filled with intricate murals and Buddha statues but also about a million tourists to the point that we were sardined into slowly moving crowds circumnavigating the central chedi. Despite the steep entrance fee we paid, we quickly got out of there and moved on to find a nature trail to go for a hike and see some birds (sadly no luck this time). We next drove further up the mountain to visit Buhping Palace, one of the principal royal residences, which proved to be a much more pleasant place than the wat to stroll around before catching another songtaew back to the city (along with a Canadian guy who worked in film in Vancouver!).

Sukothai (Jan 21-22, 2025)
======

Having so far spent the entirety of our time in Northern Thailand, our next destination was the capital Bangkok. However, when we looked into train tickets we realized that everything was already booked up leaving us looking at a 12+ hour bus ride (from the outset we’d decided to avoid flights wherever possible and instead travel overland to see more of the countryside and reduce our carbon footprint). Since neither of us wanted to take a super long bus trip, we decided to stop along the way in Sukothai, one of Thailand’s most historic temple sites (spontaneous stops like this are a definite silver lining of poor planning!).

<br/>

If you’re visiting Thailand and interested in its history, I highly recommend a visit to [Sukothai Historical Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhothai_Historical_Park). It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site preserving the ancient ruins of the capital of the Sukothai Kingdom, considered to be the birthplace of Thai civilization, which ruled Thailand in the 13<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> century. We rented bikes and spent the morning exploring the central area of the historic park visiting Wat Mahathat, Wat Traphang Ngoen, Wat Si Sawai, Wat Sa Si, and Wat Phrapai Luang. In the afternoon, we got a separate entrance ticket and visited the northern part of the park to see Wat Phrapai Luang and Wat Si Chum which houses an enormous 15m seated Buddha statue. We spent our evening strolling through Sukothai’s charming night market and grabbing street food to eat on the grass by the town lake along with everyone else. Next stop the capital!

<br/>

After a 7.5hr bus ride from Sukothai, we arrived in Bangkok and got a Grab taxi to our hostel near Khao San Road (a neighborhood that Lonely Planet hilariously describes as “a rite of passage for backpackers coming to Southeast Asia”). While checking out nearby restaurants on Google Maps, I discovered we were only a couple blocks away from “Bangkok Poutine” so we obviously had to see if it was any good; everyone eating there was Canadian, and a lady from Montreal across from us told me that she’d come because she was homesick for poutine - a feeling I could relate to!

_City shot in Bangkok near Khao San Road_
<br/>

On our first day in Bangkok, we walked around the city visiting a couple of the classic tourist stops: visiting the Bangkok National Museum (spent about 5hrs there - definitely worth a visit!), checking out the city pillar, and exploring the sprawling complex at Wat Pho (notably including a 46m long reclining Buddha statue that was uncomfortable packed with other tourists). We spent the next day getting lost in the interconnected labyrinths of Bangkoks mega-malls and buying a few missing items. Since Chinese New Year was about to start, the malls were all decked out with crazy decorations to celebrate the Year of the Snake; more than once, we stumbled across store clerks in Chinese dragon costumes putting on performances with full marching bands!

<br/>

Since we had to pick up some Canadian immigration paperwork that had been re-routed to the Bangkok visa control center across town, we used that as an excuse to take a ferry along Bangkok’s _klongs_ (canal system) which was a fun and cheap way to get around town. Spent our last day exploring Chinatown around Yaowarat Road which comes alive at night as hundreds of Chinese street food vendors set up their carts to cater to the giant ambling crowds (especially fun since Chinese New Year was about to start and there were decorations and elaborate outfits **everywhere**).

<br/>

The next day we packed up and headed to Bangkok’s massive central train station to catch a 14hr overnight train down south to the Malaysian border. Although it would’ve been convenient to take the train all the way across the border into Malaysia, we decided instead to do our border crossing via ferry from the west coast of Southern Thailand due to the risk of terrorist attacks on train routes near politically unstable overland border (including two as recently as December 2022).

Pak Bara (Jan 29-31, 2025)

<br/>

After a surprisingly nice overnight train ride, we arrived in Hat Yai and took a local bus west to the coastal town of Pak Bara. For about 99% of tourists, Pak Bara is a short stop-over on the way to Thailand’s famous Ko Lipe island but, since Chinese New Year had just started and everything in Ko Lipe was either booked or ridiculously pricey, we decided to spend a couple days in Pak Bara before the ferry to Langkawi, Malaysia.

<br/>

In hindsight, Pak Bara was another really nice spontaneous decision as we were able to find pretty affordable accommodations right next to Mu Ko Phetra National Park. Every day we’d go walking through the sleepy little town and were pleasantly surprised by the amazing wildlife about. Troops of dusky langurs were a frequent sight - usually found walking along electric cables and jumping around the trees by the main road. Every day we’d go on a stroll around town with our binoculars and cameras which rewarded us with some fun shots of great egrets, brahminy kites, chestnut-headed bee-eaters, green-billed malkohas, and even a pair of oriental pied-hornbills snacking on a lizard (photos [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-01-31-portfolio-4-thailand/)).

_Asian water monitor near the boardwalk in Mu Ko Phetra National Park_
<br/>

Since Sara loves geology, we were interested in visiting the “time travel” boardwalk of Mu Ko Phetra National Park (a UNESCO Global Geopark); as you walk north along the boardwalk, you encounter a geological seam that separates the red sandstone of the Cambrian period (~500 million years ago) from the limestone of the Ordovician period (~400 million years) allowing you to essentially traverse 100 million years of geology in less than a km along the ocean. To our delight, we also saw a **giant** Asian water monitor (the second largest lizard species after the Komodo dragon) hanging out about 10 feet from the boardwalk languidly moving along the rocks and frequently probing its environment with a long forked tongue. Having relaxed for a couple days and exhausted what there was to see in Pak Bara, our next stop was the island of Langkawi in Malaysia!
