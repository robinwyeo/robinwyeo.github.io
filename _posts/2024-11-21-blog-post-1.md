Thoughts on packing lists and our 9 hour layover in Singapore’s Jewel Changi Airport

Packing List
======

Sara and I had lots of time to analyze (and over-analyze) our packing lists starting months out from our flight to Southeast Asia since we’d been thinking about this trip for so long. Our primary considerations were weight  and functionality in hot+humid climates since we plan on each living out of a carry-on backpack for the better part of the next year. Can’t recommend the subreddit [r/onebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/) enough for advice on literally EVERYTHING from shoes to sun hoodies to backpacking bags and daypacks. We worked through many iterations of our packing list which I formatted based on the template we used for our summer backcountry backpacking trip in the High Sierras (Kings Canyon, CA) with Skurka Adventures. I’m including a link to [my personal packing list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AT5OKLgMLwh7rdUKPVyP8ff7T-tzm9PgbVl-ai-uflw/edit) below for anyone curious about the gear I’m bringing along to Southeast Asia (time will tell how good a packing list this is…).

Some of the biggest packing choices were around what bag(s) to bring (I went with the Osprey Farpoint 55L which is a combo 40L backpack + 15L daypack), what technology was worth the weight (ditched the 4.2lb MacBook Pro and got a used iPad+keyboard setup at just over 2lbs), and what camera system to go with (since I’m primarily interested in wildlife/bird photography on this trip, I went with the Canon EOS R7 with its 18-150mm kit lens and the 100-400mm telephoto lens (generously lent to me by my friend Neel)).

Want to also make a plug for the organization [Not Just Tourists](https://njt.net/) which provides travelers with suitcases of medical supplies to donate at health clinics in developing countries. Sara discovered this organization while researching our trip and we were able pick up and travel with a suitcase of medical supplies to donate to a free clinic in Phnom Penh. Really was extremely little work to do a good deed so go check them out before your next trip!

Flight to Cambodia (with a 9 hour layover in Singapore!)
======

Our flight out to Southeast Asia was on November 21, 2024:
* Toronto - Vancouver _(5 hours)_
* Vancouver - Singapore _(17 hours)_
* Singapore - Phnom Penh _(2 hours)_

Since neither of us had ever visited Singapore and it was way outside of our budget for our travels, we decided it might be fun to pick a flight itinerary with a 9 hour layover in Singapore so we could explore the Jewel Changi Airport which boasts the world’s largest indoor waterfall (40 meters) and the surrounding Shiseido Forest Valley which is a multi-level indoor rainforest with 2000+ plants/trees from around the world.
