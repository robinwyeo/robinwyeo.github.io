Chile - our last stop in South America
======

The most surprising thing about our time in Chile was just how different the vibe of the country felt to Peru and Bolivia. In hindsight, considering the close histories of Peru and Bolivia compared to Chile as well as the wealth disparity between Chile and its South American neighbors (Chile's GDP per capita is roughly ~2x that of Peru's and ~4x that of Bolivia's) we shouldn't have been surprised, but in truth we had done very little research about Chile and went in somewhat blind. Sometimes that's part of the fun of traveling though! After 8 weeks backpacking in South America, Sara and I were feeling pretty good about our Spanish until we crossed the Chilean border and suddenly couldn't understand **anything**. We would learn that this is a pretty common experience among visitors since Chilean Spanish is super different from the rest of South America and among the hardest to understand for non-native speakers (mainly due to a combination of fast pace, unique slang, and most critifcally the tendency to frequently drop consonants like 'D's from words).

Elqui Valley (Oct 5-11, 2025) 
======

After an easy border crossing from Bolivia to Chile, we found ourselves in the small town of San Pedro de Atacama (which reminded us of Arizona and New Mexico). Since we'd just spent the last 3 days in the Bolivian salt flats and desert, we decided to skip over Chile's Atacama desert, and proceed immediately to our first major stop: Elqui Valley, a verdant region about 1000km south of us nestled between arid mountains famous for its pisco distilleries. After a brief lunch in San Pedro, we walked over to the local bus depot only to realize that we'd forgotten about the time change between Chile and Bolivia and had managed to miss our bus (situations like this make me glad I love to read because a missed bus then becomes an opportunity to read for a couple hours). Two hours later we caught the next bus out of town which dropped us off in the medium-sized city of Calama (not one of our favorite places) followed by another long bus that got us into Antofagasta around 11pm. The next day we took a ~12 hour bus ride through the desert and along the coast all the way down to La Serena, the biggest city in the Elqui Valley where we spent the next few days.

_Visit to La Serena's Archaelogical Museum which housed one of Easter Island's iconic Moai statues_

La Serena is Chile's second oldest city and serves as the bridge between the expansive Atacama desert to the North and the country's fertile central valleys to the South. We spent a few days there visiting the historic churches, exploring the fish markets, and visiting the Archaeological Museum to learn more about the region's history. La Serena was also our first opportunity to really try Chilean food which, though definitely less exciting than Peruvian cuisine, still had some standouts that we'd spend the next 4 weeks revisiting frequently: *cazuela de vaca*, a clear-broth soup made with potato, corn, and a giant hunk of beef, *completos*, chilean hot dogs that come in an endless variety of forms (our favorite being the *italiano* where avocado, tomato, and mayonnaise make up the colors of the Italian flag), and *churrascos*, thinly sliced steak sandwiches which we usually ordered Italiano-style. While the food in Chile was pricey and not overly exciting, these three dishes were ones that we returned to the most frequently from the northern reaches of the Atacama desert all the way down to the remote Southern towns in Patagonia.

_Relaxing at our hostel in Vicuna with the neighborhood cat_

Although we liked La Serena much more than we expected, our real destination in the Elqui Valley was Vicuna, a picturesque little town about 60km east of La Serena in the heart of Elqui Valley. Vicuna is especially famous for its world-class astronomical observatories, its pisco distilleries, and as the birthplace of Nobel Prize-winning poet Gabriela Mistral. We spent three nights in Vicuna, staying at a laid-back hostel with lounge chairs and hammocks out in the sandy backyard where we quickly befriended the hostel's cat. One day we rented bikes and did a 50km cycling tour of Elqui Valley with stunning views of the surrounding pisco vineyards and mountains with a fellow backpacker from Germany that we'd met at our hostel. Along the way we stopped to visit the school where Gabriela Mistral taught, visited a Pisco distillery to learn about Pisco grape cultivation and production, had our first taste of copao juice (native Chilean cactus fruit), and stopped at a craft brewery to try a tasting flight of local beers.

I was particularly excited to discover that Vicuna even had a small family-run entomology museum so Sara and I spent an hour there one afternoon learning more about Chile's endemic butterfly and beetle species. Perhaps the highlight of our time in Elqui Valley was visiting one of the area's astronomical observatories (this part of Chile is arguably one of the very top places in the entire world to go stargazing, and the area around Vicuna is sprinkled with a half dozen world-class observatories within easy driving distance). We joined a small group at sunset and drove 45min out to visit the Pangue Observatory where we waited until nighfall and then spent an hour or two looking through a **massive** optical telescope at distant galaxies and nebulae with a professional astronomer who patiently answered our thousand questions.

Santiago (Oct 12-14, 2025) 
======

On to the capital! After a relaxing week in Northern Chile, we took a series of buses from Vicuna to Santiago, Chile's capital city. Sprawling and metropolitan with an indefinably different but recognizably European feel to it, Santiago was a fun city to spend a couple days exploring. We stayed in Providencia, one of the nicer central barrios near downtown Santiago, and spent most of our time on foot exploring the city. From speaking with other Chileans and backpackers, the choice of barrio matters a lot when visiting Santiago as some neighborhoods can be pretty sketchy, and we wanted to feel comfortable walking around by ourselves on foot. We spent a whole afternoon walking around Santiago Metropolitan Park (covering roughly 1800 acres, it's Latin America's largest urban park), and visited the famous 14m statue of the Virgin of Immaculate Conception.

Another day we walked from Providencia to the central downtown area to visit the Plaza de Armas and check out the Chilean Museum of Pre-Columbian History to learn about the cultural and artistic legacy of the indigenous peoples of Central and South America (five stars - one of my favorite museums from our South America trip). We also visited the excellent (and free!) National Museum of Fine Arts situated right off downtown in the lush urban Parque Forestal.

Lakes District & Chiloe (Oct 15-22, 2025) 
======

From Santiago, we flew south to Puerto Montt and rented a SUV so we could explore the Lakes District (Los Lagos) and the island of Chiloe. With its perfect cone volcanoes, deep glacial lakes, and temperate rainforests, the Lakes District somehow feels at once like the Pacific Northwest and pastoral areas of the Swiss Alps. Needless to say, it makes for a fun road trip (highly recommended to rent a vehicle since public transport is pretty limiting). 

![Los_Lagos-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1SH2sJHPfpxhONheJL3s8DInTYMduLdj1&sz=w1000)
_Beautiful town of Puerto Varas, one of the better places to base yourself out of while roadtripping around the Lakes District_

The Lakes District is also distinct from the rest of Chile for having a strong Germanic heritage that is evident in the region's architecture, culture, and food. In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, the Chilean government selectively recruited German families to colonize its wild southern frontier resulting in a distinct Germanic-Chilean culture in Los Lagos that goes back well over a hundred and fifty years. In contrast to the Spanish colonial style adobe buildings seen everywhere in the northern and central areas of the country, buildings in Los Lagos are constructed primarily out of wood as early German settlers adapted their traditional _Fachwerk_ (timber framing) style to Chile's temperate rainforests. This is most dramatically seen in the area's famous UNESCO Heritage churches, the most famous and beautiful of which are found on Chiloe Island and are constucted entirely out of wood without the use of a single nail; historically, these were built using the region's massive Alerce trees which were logged to create weatherproof wooden shingles that adorn all of the region's historic buildings in a fish-scale pattern (logging endangered Alerce trees is now highly illegal and they’ve even been declared a National Monument of Chile).

We spent our first day in the Lakes District driving clockwwise around Lago Llanquihue and made our first stop in the scenic town of Frutillar just as it started pouring giving us a good excuse to pop inside a bed and breakfast to have some food and try _kuchen_ (traditional Chilean-German fruit tart just like the ones found in South Dakota at Schmeckfest!). We continued our loop around the lake (with the beautiful Osorno Volcano partially shrouded in clouds defining the landscape) and visited the Vicente Perez National Park to go on a hike. On our way to the trailheard we saw a pair of _chilla_ (also known as Patagonia foxes which is confusing since, despite looking exaclty like foxes, they are not in fact true foxes); they must have been used to humans frequently visiting the park since they were very accomodating for their photoshoot. We did a 8 mile hike to the Mirador del Alerces (despite the name, no Alerces!) then hiked back along the beach before driving to our refugio in the nearby tiny town of Los Cascadas; for dinner we stopped at one of the region's ubiquitous hot dog and fry shacks which reminded us fondly of the millions of fry shacks we passed during our roadtrip across Canada. The next day we explored the eastern part of Los Lagos in off-and-on rain and did another waterfall hike before returning to Puerto Varas (highly recommend staying here if you're visitng Los Lagos) to spend the night before setting off for Chiloe the next day.

A short drive and ferry ride across the Chacao Channel brought us from Los Lagos to the nearby island of Chiloe; historically isolated from the mainland, this short crossing brings you to a different world entirely, one with its own distinct culture, mythology, and architecture. Whereas driving through Los Lagos is somewhat reminiscent of the rolling pastoral landscapes found in Switzerland, the vibes in Chiloe are much closer to the misty and rural areas of the Pacific Northwest.

While Chiloe is absolutely worth visiting in its own right, I'll admit that one of the principle reasons it made the cut in our travel itinerary was our overwhelming desire to see penguins in the wild. Back up in Elqui Valley, we'd attempted to see one of Chile's resident penguin species at the Humboldt Penguin National Reserve (a couple hours north of La Serena) but caught a bad weather window when none of the boats were running; luckily for us, the Islotes de Punihuil off of Chiloe's northwest coast were another reliable spot to see not only the Humboldt Penguin but the Magellanic Penguin as well (in fact, these islets are the only place in the world where these two penguin species nest side-by-side). So, of course, one of the first things we did upon arriving in Chiloe was drive to Punihuil and book a boat ride out to the nearby islets to see our first wild penguins!

We spent a total of 4 nights in Chiloe, spending our days roadtripping between small towns, birding, going on hikes, and stopping to see as many of the famous UNESCO Heritage churches as we could. Since we had a rental car, instead of staying in town at a hotel or hostel we'd find guesthouses in the countryside where (for the same price) we could stay in a private cabin with its own bathroom, kitchen, and wood-burning heating stove. One day we drove west to the Parque Nacional de Chiloe and went on the famous Muelle de las Almas ("Dock of Souls") hike which takes you through forest and pastureland to a wooden pier curving aggresively towards the sky, leading nowhere, perched on the edge of a massive cliff overlooking the Pacific. This surreal art installation was built by sculptor Marcelo Orellana Rivera in honor of the Mapuche-Huilliche myth in which the dead must travel to these cliffs to await the _Tempilcahue_, a spectral boatman that ferries them to the afterlife.

After 4-5 days on Chiloe island, we returned to the mainland for a few more days to continue exploring Los Lagos. Our days were similarly filled with roadtripping, birding, and hiking as we tried to cram in as many national parks and reserves as we could before our flight out to Patagonia. On nearly our last day in the area, the cloud cover finally cleared up giving us our first unobstructed sight of Osorno volcano, letting us know it was time to move on further south to Patagonia.

Northern Patagonia (Oct 23 - Nov 2, 2025) 
======

Chile is roughly broken up into 5 main latitudinal zones (Norte Grande, Norte Chico, Zona Central, La Frontera, and Sur) and our travels down from the Atacama desert, through Elqui Valley to Santiago and then through the Lakes District had allowed us to see 4/5 so all that was remaining was Sur, the untamed southern region of Chile that contains Patagonia. Out of the whole country of Chile, this was undoubtedly the region we were most excited to visit. Since the vast majority of international visitors to Patagonia head directly to Torres del Paine National Park, we'd heard that this southern part of Patagonia had become extremely crowded and expensive (with park fees comparable to North America or Europe); as a result, we decided to leave Patagonia's most famous national park for a future trip and instead spent our time in Northern Patagonia (Aysen Region), a wilder and much less visited part of Patagonia that contains the Carretera Austral, a scenic and winding paved road legendary for roadtripping that cuts across the vast wilderness connecting Northern Patagonia's many national parks.

![Patagonia-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1t356zvs2Ja-kLUNpafRWglbbJjLOJHeK&sz=w1000)
_Sara on a hike in Patagonia National Park_

We flew from Puerto Montt to Balmaceda, and rented another SUV to begin our ~10 day roadtrip through Patagonia. Within an hour of landing we were on the road with GPS coordinates in hand from eBird on the hunt for the Lesser Rhea (also known as Darwin's Rhea), the bird we were probably the most excited to see in Chile (even more than the penguins and flamingos!). Our drive from Balmaceda took us through the town of Coyahique and then out for 2 hours away from any sign of civilization to the remote wind-swept steppes which border Argentina (it's hard to overstate how little there was there - no towns, no national parks, no humans). As we got closer and closer to Argentina with no sign of the rheas, we began to lose hope when, within ~20km of the border, as if by magic, three of them suddenly appeared within a few hundred feet of us giving us an unobstructed view for a couple minutes until they sprinted off into the distance. Despite the roughly 6 hour total detour from anything else worth seeing, I call it an unqualified success and Sara just declared to me it was one of her favorite memories from South America.

_Did you know there were ostriches in South America? I definitely didn't! (note for accuracy: rheas are not actually ostriches but distant cousins)_

Since bad weather the next day made a full day of hiking pretty unappealing, we decided to spend the whole day driving south to Patagonia National Park (~8hrs), Patagonia's youngest national park and supposedly one of the best places in Chile for wildlife spotting (note: its naming is a bit confusing but Patagonia NP is simply one of dozens of national parks in the greater region of Patagonia). When you picture Patagonia in your mind, what you're picturing almost certainly looks nothing like Patagonia National Park. Instead of the lush, temperate rainforests of Northern Patagonia or the dramatic snow-covered peaks of southern Patagonia, Patagonia NP is 750,000 acres of arid grassland and, to be honest, a relatively boring sight were it not for the wildlife. The park is home to immense herds of guanaco (camelids related to llamas) as well as flamingos, Andean condors, llamas, endangered huemuls (endemic South Andean deer), and even elusive pumas (we saw all of the above except the puma since we never got up early enough to catch them at dawn).

_We even spotted a huemul while driving out of Patagonia NP on our last day_

We spent two days in Patagonia National Park alternating between long drives through the paved sections of the park and hikes up to various sub-alpine lakes, scouting for wildlife and birds pretty much constantly. Some of the more memorable wildlife moments were watching an Andean condor (an absolute giant at 10+ ft wingspan) getting harassed by a tiny American kestrel that was repeatedly dive bombing it from above. Another time, we had just wrapped up the Sendero Atlas hike (20km, 3000ft ascent) right at sunset and were pulling out of the trailhead parking lot when an Austral pygmy owl landed on a roadsign **literally** right next to our car allowing me to snap one of my favorite owl photos out of the driver's seat through Sara’s rolled down window.

_Probably my favorite owl sighting to date: the Austral pygmy owl (though this is a low bar as I'm terrible at owling)_

After a day or two roadtripping along the Carretera Austral, we based ourselves out of Puerto Rio Tranquilo to book a boat trip out to see the San Rafael Glacier, one of the most memorable trips we took in Patagonia. Starting a bit before dawn, we drove the ~2hrs from Puerto Rio Tranquilo along the Bahia Exploradores to Puerto Grosse where we boarded a boat with our tour group and set out along scenic fjords for another ~2hrs until we arrived at San Rafael Laguna National Park. As the lush-forest covered banks receded from view and we approached the massive glacier, we first passed through a stretch of water that was increasingly filled with huge white/blue icebergs. 

![Patagonia-7](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1v6S9Ieea64wLQxzit3JZt2Yt_7q_0i0U&sz=w1000)
_Icebergs surrounded our boat on the approach to the San Rafael glacier_

In this iceberg-strewn water, the **massive** San Rafael Glacier comes into view as an immense ice wall in the distance. For the next hour or two, our boat would slowly and carefully navigate its way through the iceberg field towards the glacier which, due to its immense size, appeared to barely grow in the distance. At one point, our guide asked us all how far away we thought the San Rafael glacier was from our boat and we all guessed a few hundred meters only to learn that we were in fact 2km away which is basically as close as you can get to it safely since giant glacial chunks routinely calve off the wall (plus if you got much closer you'd just be staring directly up an ice wall instead of at it). Truly mind-boggling. Before turning around and returning to the mainland, we all got to try a local liqueur made out of calafate berries served over ~30,000 year old glacial ice chipped off from one of the many surrounding icebergs.

![Patagonia-8](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1LG7Lo2oeliKWuH4IUQaVTasC-4raxx1M&sz=w1000)
_Visiting the San Rafael Glacier_

We boated back to the port and then drove back along the same road to town, stopping in another national park to do a short hike up to see another glacier (the Exploradores Glacier) where we also got a great sighting of the Chucao tapaculo, one of the most iconic birds in the Aysen region (its picture is often seen adorning coasters and t-shirts around the small towns).

![Patagonia-9](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1vCGQjceOE-jDrKs9g5NcrgYho4lt-BQT&sz=w1000)
_After days of only seeing glimpses of this bird, this Chucao tapaculo hopped out right in front of us on the trail and posed for a few seconds_

We next continued on from Puerto Rio Tranquilo, driving further north to Cerro Castillo National Park, one of Northern Patagonia's premier trekking destination whose jagged granite peaks, dramatic glacial lakes, and hanging glaciers are reminiscent of its more famous cousin Torres Del Paine (though slightly less impressive, the upside to trekking in Cerro Castillo is that we usually had the trails to ourselves!). On our first day there, we accidentally arrived at the park gate an hour too late to begin the hike so instead spent the day driving along a new road to the Argentinian border (again) to look for birds, and visiting an archaelogical site that contains human handprints painted in caves dating back 3000 years. Getting an earlier start the next day to the national park, we did the long ~25km (3600 ft ascent) hike up along the New Zealand camp trail, among frosty forests and out into dramatic icefields surrounded on all sides by jagged snow-covered peaks until we had to turn around since it was getting late and the snowfield becomes especially treacherous in uneven light.

_Our turning-around point on the New Zealand Camp trail in Cerro Castillo National Park_

We continued driving north back to the Balmaceda airport where we swapped out our first rental car for a Subaru and did the long drive north along the Carretera Austral up to Pumalin National Park (which on a map is basically all the way back up to the Lakes District). We initially weren't sure that we'd have time to include Pumalin NP on our roadtrip; in hindsight we were so glad we squeezed it in as the drive from Coyhaique up to Pumalin alone is worth it and possibly the prettiest drive of our entire sabbatical (the only contenders we could think of were motorbiking in Vietnam and driving the Columbia icefield in Banff). One of my favorite things about roadtripping all the way from Patagonia National Park up to Pumalin National Park (~750km as the crow flies) is the diversity of landscapes you get to experience: from wind-swept pampas to iceberg-laden fjords to dramatic snowy mountains all the way up to the lush temperate rainforests of Pumalin which are eerily similar to the Pacific Northwest. We spent our time in Pumalin doing various dayhikes and roadtripping to birding hotspots; some highlights were seeing the ancient Alerce trees we'd learned so much about in Chiloe and hiking up the steep 2000ft of Chaiten Volcano.

_Sunset after the drive back from Pumalin National Park to Coyhaique_

Just as in the Lakes District, we spent the majority our nights in small private cabanas in remote areas outside of the major towns; while not luxurious by any means, these were some of my favorite accomodations from our time in South America - pretty affordable, isolated, and, with wood-burning stoves for heating, extremely cozy, they had the added benefit of being out in the countryside so that the morning and evening birding right outside was usually excellent from the front porch. Two memorable examples were staying in the rainforest right down the road from Chaiten Volcano and watching dolphins at dawn and dusk 50ft from the rocky beach a stone's throw from our cabana, and staying in a gorgeous cowboy/ranching themed cabana near Coyhaique whose super friendly owner told us all about his rescue pet - a deaf albino alpaca.

We finally returned to Balmaceda airport one last time for a flight out to Santiago. Back in the capital, this time we decided to stay in the Barrio Italio to explore a new neighborhood for 24 hours before catching out flight out back to North America via Mexico!
