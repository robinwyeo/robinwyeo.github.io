3 weeks in Laos
======

Our route through 3 weeks in Laos from southern Don Det (Si Phan Don) to the northwest border town of Hua Xai [(Link to interactive map)](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1FOQHo_KntEd3bjvpmKUR80OMwme7fxE&usp=sharing)

Si Phan Don (Dec 19-23, 2024)
======

After a month in Cambodia, we took the bus up from Banlung and crossed the border into Laos in Si Phan Don (also known as “The 4000 Islands”). We crossed the Cambodia-Laos border with a French couple and their two young kids and learned about their own sabbatical and homeschooling their kids while on the road for a year (gave me an opportunity to practice my rusty French!). Two buses and a short boat ride later, we arrived in Don Det, a small island in Si Phan Don, popular among backpackers for its stunning views and laid-back vibes.

_View of the Mekong biking around Don Det_

We got ourselves a bungalow with a balcony and hammock on the banks of the Mekong River and spent a few days doing little besides relaxing, curating through our million bird photos, reading, and journaling. After 3 days jungle trekking in Virachey National Park, Don Det was the perfect place to unwind, drink a Beerlao (seemingly the national drink of Laos), and enjoy the sunset on the Mekong River.

_Li Phi Somphamit waterfalls on Don Khon_

So we didn’t get too bored doing nothing, we went on daily bike rides around the islands; the notable highlight being our visits to the Li Phi Somphamit waterfalls on the neighboring island Don Khon. The banks of the waterfall and surrounding forests also had the best birding we found in the region so we visited a few times with our cameras and binoculars to spot some new species in Laos.

_Live music at Ousa Library Bar_

In the evenings, we’d wander around the small island and find new spots to eat and hang out - my favorite being Ousa Library Bar where there was live music from locals and international backpackers alike every night (in Laotian, English, French, Spanish, Chinese, and probably more we couldn’t place).

Pakse & Thakhek (Dec 23-26, 2024)
======

![Photo-4](/images/Blog-3/Pakse-5.jpeg)
_Flat tire out of Don Det on our way to Pakse_

Something we’d read about Laos was that transit can be unpredictable and chaotic (even by Southeast Asian standards) and that quickly proved true for us. You never really get issued a ticket for anything and departure/arrival times are more of a suggestion than a guarantee but you do always end up where you’re trying to go. About an hour into our bus ride to Pakse, our minivan transport got a flat. After 30+ min of trying to change the tire, our driver realized that the spare was also flat. Undeterred, he hailed down a stranger on a passing motorbike, jumped on the back, and took off down the road carrying the tire on his side. About 30min later he arrived back on a different stranger’s motorbike now carrying a new tire, triumphantly raised his fist, successfully changed the tire, and we were back on our way.

_Christmas market in Pakse_

Pakse and Thakhek are not usually on most traveler’s lists when visiting Laos but we decided to stop there since we needed a post office and didn’t want to be doing 48hrs of transit over Christmas (plus it was nice to be away from tourists and backpackers after Don Det). We had to idea what to expect in Laos for Christmas but it turns out that, at least in Pakse, there’s plenty of Christmas spirit. We randomly stumbled upon a Christmas market full of Laotian families dressed up for Christmas hanging out at the night food stalls while their kids ran around screaming and playing. One little girl took a fancy to Sara and kept jokingly threatening/attempting to spray her with a can of fake Christmas frost. For Christmas Day, we got a guesthouse outside of town and took a cooking class with the owner, Ngoc, who taught us to make pork laap (the national dish of Laos) and traditional Laotian coconut doughnuts.

We continued north from Pakse up to Thakhek where we were amused to see a goat riding up top of the minivan with our backpacking bags for the entirety of the 8hr drive.

Na Hin (Dec 27-28, 2024)
======

_A picture of the songtaew we took from Thakhek to Na Hin. These modified pickups have open-air benches on the back and are typical for long-distance transport between cities in Laos_

We decided to visit the remote town of Na Hin because it was where the [bare-faced bulbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare-faced_bulbul) was discovered in 2009 and is one of Laos’ most notable birding locations. Unfortunately for us, it was extremely windy the morning we had planned to go out to look for it so we didn’t see any birds hiking around the area’s limestone karsts. Hopefully next time!

_My very janky motorbike on the road to Kong Lor Cave from Na Hin_

Despite our bad luck birding, being in this remote area gave us the chance to go visit the Kong Lor Cave which is super out of the way for most visitors but pretty incredible. Since the cave was about 45km from Na Hin, Sara and I rented motorbikes (first time for us both!) and did the stunning drive to Kong Lor along a road surrounded by limestone karsts.

![Photo-9](/images/Blog-3/Na-Hin-11.jpeg)
_Boat ride through Kong Lor Cave_

Kong Lor is less a cave and more an enormous cavern system that stretches over 7.5km with  connecting giant chambers (with ceilings as high as 100m at points!). Upon arriving, you jump on a small boat with a guide and glide along the underground river, stopping in various caverns most of which are entirely in the dark besides your headlamps.

Vientiane (Dec 28-30, 2024)
======

Since there’s no official bus that goes from the small town of Na Hin to the capital Vientiane, we asked at the hostel across the street and were told to hail down any passenger songtaew or bus heading west with a sign for Vientiane. Although we never saw a transport with a Vientiane sign, we jumped on a westward bus heading to Paksan since that was in the right direction. At the Paksan bus depot, we were then were pointed to another bus, charged $1 each for the transfer, and eventually made our way to the capital. Like I said, Laos transport is somewhat chaotic but you always get where you need to go!

_One of Vientiane’s many wats_

Unfortunately, a day or so before getting to Vientiane, I started feeling mildly feverish (followed soon after by Sara) so our time in Vientiane was limited to a couple short outings while we recuperated in the hotel.

_Curtain of prosthetic limbs displayed at the COPE Visitor Center_

One of our most interesting stops in Vientiane was a visit to the [COPE Visitor Center (Cooperative Orthotic and Prosthetic Enterprise)](https://copelaos.org/), an educational center established to raise awareness about the impact of unexplored ordinances (UXOs) in Laos and to help those that have suffered injuries and mobility-related disabilities due to UXOs. If you’re visiting Vientiane, I HIGHLY recommend this visit (it was actually recommended to us as the only must-see in Vientiane by our friend Neel). The center features exhibits including personal stories of UXO survivors, documentaries, and displays of prosthetic limbs and bomb casings. We found the exhibits sobering and highly educational, and walked away with a greater appreciation for the resilience of the Lao people and the importance of ongoing humanitarian work being undertaken by organizations like COPE.

_Buddha Park just outside Vientiane_

On our last day in Vientiane, we took a short ride out of town to visit Xieng Khuan (also known as Buddha Park), a unique sculpture garden containing over 200 concrete sculptures of Buddhist and Hindu iconography which Sara remembered visiting as a kid way back in 1999 (unfortunately, since then they no longer allow visitors inside of the giant “Pumpkin” structure!).

Vang Vieng (Dec 30-Jan 2, 2024/25)
======

![Photo-14](/images/Blog-3/Vang-Vieng-16.jpeg)
_Vang Vieng had some of our favorite natural backdrops in Laos_

A short bus ride from the capital brought us to Vang Vieng, a backpacker hotspot in Laos that was historically known for its debaucherous riverfront party/tubing scene. Since a slew of tourist deaths in 2012 (and subsequent crackdown from the government), Vang Vieng has been undergoing a transformation into an adventure/outdoor activity destination. Today it comes off as a weird mix of young 20-something year olds partying all day on the river and an older crowd more focused on the views, kayaking, mountain biking, and paramotoring.

![Photo-15](/images/Blog-3/Vang-Vieng-17.jpeg)
_Daily view of the hot air balloons along Vang Vieng’s riverfront_

Due to the somewhat lax safety standards in Laos, we mainly stuck to mountain biking around the surrounding limestone karsts to find good hiking trails and relaxing at the riverfront restaurants and enjoying the views from the ground. Probably tied with Don Det as the prettiest place we visited in Laos!

Luang Prabang (Jan 3-5, 2025)
======

![Photo-16](/images/Blog-3/Luang-Prabang-19.jpeg)
_Luang Prabang’s famous night market and Haw Pha Bang at sunset_

After a few days in Vang Vieng, we upgraded our transport from bus to train and booked tickets on Laos’ new railway system (opened in 2021) to take us the 2 hours north to Luang Prabang, a UNESCO World Heritage city due to its rich history and cultural significance. Out of all of our destinations in Laos, Luang Prabang was my favorite, mostly due to the beautiful architecture, super good food, and relaxed vibe.

![Photo-20](/images/Blog-3/Luang-Prabang-23.jpeg)
_Golden Buddha Seated on a Naga seen at a temple in Luang Prabang’s Old City_

We spent a day exploring the Old City and wandering through Wat Xiengthong, Wat Sensoukharam, and Wat Souvannapoumaram before trekking up to Mount Phousi to enjoy the sunset over the city. As a local would later tell us, “If you’re in Luang Prabang and haven’t climbed Mt Phousi then you haven’t yet arrived in Luang Prabang!”. Nice hike and view from the top but we’re glad we went in the early afternoon to avoid the masses of tourists that converge up there around sunset!

![Photo-21](/images/Blog-3/Luang-Prabang-24.jpeg)
_Trying some local specialties: Luang Prabang sausage and Kaipen (dried riverweed)_

One of my favorite things about Luang Prabang was the food. We never visited the same place twice and almost every meal ranked among my favorites in Laos (and while obviously more expensive than rural Laos, our meals were still all around $5-8)

![Photo-19](/images/Blog-3/Luang-Prabang-20.jpeg)
_Kuang Si Waterfall_

We visited the Kuang Si Waterfall which cascades over limestone formations resulting in unbelievably turquoise waters due to the high levels of calcium carbonate. Worth checking out while there is the [Tat Kuang Si Bear Rescue Centre](https://freethebears.org/pages/laos-sanctuaries), an animal sanctuary that rescues and rehabilitates orphaned moon bear cubs.

![Photo-17](/images/Blog-3/Luang-Prabang-21.jpeg)
_Weaving a scarf using a traditional loom in a Pad Oo village on the outskirts of Luang Prabang (Khai district)_

On one of our first days in Luang Prabang, we visited the [Traditional Arts and Ethnology Center (TAEC)](https://www.taeclaos.org/), a museum and educational center focused on the diverse ethnic cultures present in Laos (despite only having a population of ~7.5 million, Laos has over 130 distinct ethnic groups). Would highly recommend a visit - we found their special exhibition on [cultural appropriation and plagiarism in the fashion industry](https://www.taeclaos.org/oma/) particularly thought-provoking. At TAEC, we met Ton, a senior staff ethnologist for the center, who offered to act as our guide over the next few days since we were interested in visiting the surrounding villages and learning more about the different ethnic groups in Loas. One stop was to Pad Oo village where we got to meet local artisans weaving scarves, wood-carving (e.g. masks relating to PuYer-YaYer), and making 100-proof rice whiskey (there were some very drunk chickens around the distilling barrels…).

![Photo-18](/images/Blog-3/Luang-Prabang-22.jpeg)
_Hmong New Year celebration in Vang Ngern village_

Since we happened to be in Luang Prabang on the last day of the Hmong New Year, Ton brought us to the local New Year’s celebration (which is the second-largest annual gathering of the Hmong people in Laos). Very interesting to learn about the traditional courtship/marriage rituals (involving a ball-throwing game pictured above) and admire the diversity of traditional apparel.

Mekong River Slow Boat (Jan 6-8, 2025)
======

_View from the slow boat up the Mekong River_

To cross the border into Thailand, we decided to take the 2 day slow boat up the Mekong River, passing through Pakbeng (where we spent the night) and arriving in Hua Xai right on the Laos-Thailand border. The slow boat took about 16 hours total - mostly spent relaxing, and flipping back and forth between my sci-fi book (Caliban’s War) and reading up on our upcoming month in Thailand.

<br/>

_Note: given its nickname “the Land of a Million Elephants”, we were amused to see our first and only elephant on the banks of the Mekong on our last day in Laos!_
