Off to Peru - the first country on our 3 month trip down in South America!
======

Out of all the countries on our South America trip, we gave ourselves the most time for Peru, and it somehow still didn’t feel long enough. With miles of coastline, stretching desert ranges, towering mountains, deep Amazonian jungle, ancient archaeological sites, and a world-class gastronomic scene, we easily could have spent our entire trip here but 5 weeks is a good start!

Lima (Aug 13-18, 2025) 
======

To kick off three months of travel down in South America, we decided to begin in Lima since I have lots of Peruvian family there. Plus it’s a (somewhat) familiar place having visited twice before (though the last visit was way back when I was in university).  This is the same strategy we used for Southeast Asia where we started in Cambodia due to Sara’s family’s connection to the country, and we found it helped ease us into the travel headspace after our summer back in North America which we spent roadtripping across Canada.

_Miraflores Malecón_

For our 4 days in Lima, we stayed in Miraflores, a cosmopolitan neighborhood in the heart of Lima where most tourists end up staying due to its central location and relative safety (we were warned repeatedly by my Peruvian family to take safety seriously here in Lima as muggings are super common). To get our bearings, we spent the first day wandering around Lima, visiting Parque Kennedy (which, to our delight, was full of cats) and Miraflores Malecón, a connected promenade of parks right on Lima’s cliffside offering sweeping views of the Pacific as well as its surfers and parasailers.

_The Reserve Section at Museo Larco_

To learn more about Peruvian history and culture, we visited the excellent [Museo Larco](https://www.museolarco.org/) which contains an expansive collection of ceramics from the Cupisnique, Chimú, Chancay, Nazca, and Inca cultures (what I found even more impressive than the artefacts on display was the “Reserve section” where you can see where the museum stores its >50,000 ceramic works in room after room filled to the rafters with ancient pots and sculptures). We also visited Huaca Pucllana, an important pre-Incan archaeological site in the heart of the city where you can go on a tour of the massive clay and adobe pyramid created by the Lima Culture between 200 and 700 A.D. Interestingly enough, one of the main things you learn on this tour about the Lima Culture is that we know absolutely nothing about the Lima Culture.

_Huaca Pucllana - an ancient archaeological site in the heart of Lima_

One reason I was particularly excited to visit Lima was to see my family there, who I usually only ever see every couple years when they fly up to Toronto to celebrate my Peruvian grandmother Sonja’s birthday. We spent one morning being guided around Barranco, a trendy/artistic/bohemian neighborhood in Lima by my aunt Alexandra, and cousins Jimena, Marianna, and Nico. Barranco has a super fun vibe and we spent a few hours walking through the neighborhood, stopping to visit art galleries (e.g. Dedalo, Livia Benavides Gallery with my family, and later the Lima Museum of Contemporary Art on our own), and the scenic touristy spots like the Puente de Los Suspiros (“Bridge of Sighs”).

_Hanging out with Jimena and Marianna_

For a city of ~10 million people, Lima can sometimes feel small - during our lunch in Barranco, we bumped into another uncle of mine who was celebrating my cousin Arturo’s 39<sup>th</sup> birthday just down the block! Taking advantage of this happy coincidence, Marianna, Jimena, Sara, and I joined Arturo and his friends later that evening in San Isidro for birthday drinks at a restaurant (that he and his brother designed!). On two of our other evenings in Lima, we managed to grab dinner with my aunts Alexandra and Patti (which included what was probably the best _torta de chocolate_ I’d ever had), and then with my uncle Enrique at a delicious upscale Peruvian sushi restaurant with amazing takes on sushi like scallop nigiri with truffle oil and lemon, and steak nigiri with quail egg and chalaquita.

_My cousin Arturo’s 39<sup>th</sup> birthday_

That last sentence segways perfectly into one of the most exciting things about visiting Lima (and honestly Peru as a whole) - its food. In the past decade or so, Peru has frequently been hailed as the top culinary and gastronomic destination in not just South America, but the world. In fact, according to the “World’s 50 Best Restaurants” ranking, the best restaurant in the world in 2025 is Lima’s _Maido_ (and another Lima restaurant, _Central_, won back in 2023). True to its reputation, nearly **every** meal we had in Peru (straddling price points anywhere from $5-$50 per meal) were phenomenal, and this was especially true in Lima. I sampled multiple amazing (+ cheap!) _pollo de brassa_ spots (rotisserie chicken - basically the national fast food), got great family recommendations for the best _ceviche_ we’d ever had, and ate probably too many _lomo saltados_ (which is probably my favorite Peruvian dish). I’ve already decided I’m asking Sara for a Peruvian cookbook for Christmas so I can kick off 2026 making us classic Peruvian dishes every week.

![Lima-6](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1zTIeY2OIVgVe9-V2ndCIa5F9AXTbfORW&sz=w1000)
_Ceviche, a Peruvian classic_

Unlike some of the other major cities we’d visited in Asia, Lima’s urban center didn’t have many exciting birding spots but one place 30 minutes outside the city, the Pantanos de Villa Wildlife Refuge, caught our eye. This protected wildlife refuge contains an important wetland ecosystem and is a migratory stop for birds attracting almost 200 species every year. We took an Uber outside the city and spent a couple hours with a wildlife guide walking along the wetland boardwalk and taking a boat ride to spot waterfowl and marsh-dwelling species (highlights were slate-colored coots with babies and the refuge’s star species, the [many-colored rush-tyrant](https://ebird.org/species/mcrtyr1)). From the official refuge, we walked down a somewhat sketchy stretch of road to the nearby beach where it was just us and hundreds of shorebirds around Laguna Costera. The walk was worth it however since we saw our target species, the amazing [Inca Tern](https://ebird.org/species/incter1), one of my all-time favorite Peruvian birds.

Huaraz (Aug 19-22, 2025) 
======

![Huaraz-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1bk0dLcZ1xizABo8NH5zPdNk__BacRkjs&sz=w1000)
_View of Huaraz from our hostel_

From Lima, we took a long but stunning 10hr bus ride to Huaraz, the trekking capital of Peru, going over a 14,000ft mountain pass before descending into the high-altitude city sitting at 10,000ft. Huaraz is primarily used as an acclimatization stop for trekkers intent on setting out to the Cordillera Blanca or Cordillera Huayhuash (our destination), the two most spectacular mountain ranges in the Peruvian Andes. But Huaraz itself is a city that definitely grew on us - noisy, smelly, chaotic, but charming, by the time we left Huaraz two weeks later, it had earned a soft spot in our hearts. One not-insignificant contributing factor was how exceedingly kind the owners of our super-cheap hostel were; a brother and sister that ran the place and helped us out by storing our bags for free while we trekked, made us breakfast every morning, and insisted on walking us to the various _collectivos_ we took for transport from Huaraz while there.

![Huaraz-2](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1kUSSGRjQv-0ZX3lomIsySdxk525Ur-63&sz=w1000)
_The daily market on the street where we stayed_

Coming from sea-level Lima, the 10,000ft altitude of Huaraz is no joke, and needs to be taken seriously, especially considering that treks like the Cordillera Huayhuash that we planned to hike self-guided are even higher, with days ranging from 11,000-16,500ft. Altitude sickness is **by far** the most likely reason for Andean multi-day treks to end prematurely or dangerously so most trekkers spend at least a few nights in Huaraz to allow their bodies to acclimate before embarking on their trips. We only had minor headaches and trouble sleeping while acclimating but my Garmin pulse oximeter fell to 85% SpO2 which made me feel better about getting winded walking up the stairs. We spent our first two days in Huaraz taking it easy and sorting out logistics for our Cordillera Huayhuash trek: booking transport to the start site, finalizing our route, buying maps and downloading GPS files, and renting our backpacks and camping stove/fuel (we’d brought our own tent, sleeping bags, and trekking poles from Canada).

![Huaraz-3](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1hVsMAq6FH0uzGJKqos1hgr1LVSmdxEYA&sz=w1000)
_Made it to Laguna Churrop at ~15,500ft_

On our third day in Huaraz, we did an acclimitization hike to Laguna Churrop whose trailhead is a 45min drive by _collectivo_ from Huaraz. The hike was only 8km long and up ~2300ft but started at a base elevation of 13,000ft giving us our first real taste of how much more difficult it is to hike at altitude; over the summer we’d done a 4 day backpacking trip in the Canadian Rockies with 20km per day and plenty of elevation gain so we figured we were fit enough for Huayhuash but high-altitude base elevation definitely changes the equation. Overall, the day hike felt slow but pretty easy (also gorgeous), and gave us some comfort in our abilities before setting out on our 8 day self-guided trek through the Cordillera Huayhuash the next morning.

Cordillera Huayhuash (Aug 23-31, 2025) 
======

![Huayhuash-0](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1VY34XtVB2SrI7NFN68Y50sG54bAoaSYi&sz=w1000)

Instead of doing a recap of our 8 day trek for this next section, I decided to instead pick a photo for each day and paste my unedited journal notes to give more of an unfiltered account of our time trekking in the Cordillera Huayhuash.

<br/>
**Overall Trip Stats:** <br/>
**Total Time:** 57hrs hiking over 8 days (~7hrs/day) <br/>
**Total Mileage:** 69.87mi (112km) <br/>
**Total Elevation Gain:** 17,491ft (5300m) <br/>
**Highest Pass:** 16,500ft (5000m) <br/>
**Lowest SpO2:** 78% <br/>

<br/> **AUG 23 - Mitucocha Campground**
<br/> **7hrs, 7.25mi, 2379ft** 
![Huayhuash-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1iBeW8j8aiJvBDZybsvckmLUDvnAjgkiO&sz=w1000)
_Got picked up in Huaraz at 4:30am and transferred via a series of buses through Llamac to Cuartelhuain (the first campsite on the Huayhuash circuit). Set off around 10:30am and ascended to Qaqanan pass (15,315ft) on nice groomed trail alongside a trekking group with mules. First taste of ascending above 14K feet - muy difficile but we took it slow and felt pretty good overall. Camped basically alone by Mitucocha (just us and the solo Czech trekker from the bus in the distance) since all the tour operators camped at nearby Janca. Stupidly pretty campsite all alone by the lake surrounded by mountains and glaciers._

<br/> **AUG 24 - Carhuacocha Campground**
<br/> **7hrs, 7.34mi, 2119ft**
![Huayhuash-2](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1X2SJhL93JocPoD2CqTPWi5sCuMUfrjmZ&sz=w1000)
_Surprised by how many cows are everywhere as we hike through mountainous ranch land. The cows are our friends and we try to follow their trails when we can to conserve energy. Also the birds!! So many alpine birds. Favorite so far is the Andean Goose. Today had nearly all its vert along one sketchy looking section of the alpine trail so we decided to go off-trail and ascend an earlier section that looked easier on the topographic map (spoiler: it was not easier). Ended up ascending SUPER slowly for hours along extremely technical terrain. It was fun and mentally engaging but exhausting and I hit a wall once we ascended to the ridge line and stopped for snacks. Learned my lesson not to neglect water and calorie consumption during ascents at elevation! Got a second wind after snacking and raced down the downhill at the end since sunset was approaching. Didn’t feel like trekking the last 0.7mi round Carhuacocha lake to “tent city” so we opted for dispersed camping and paid a nice lady 20 soles to camp in her cow pasture with one of the most stunning mountainous backdrops we’ve seen anywhere. Fell asleep to the sound of cows munching grass inches away from our tent._

<br/> **AUG 25 - Huayhuash Campground**
<br/> **9.5hrs, 11.28mi, 2733ft**
![Huayhuash-3](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Tr3i4n7DlI1u7pcizss0-D5aNla8d_JK&sz=w1000)
_On paper this is definitely the toughest day so far but felt a bit easier than yesterday since we limited our off-trail and I managed my water+calorie consumption better today. We were woken up at 6:30 by a balletorio (ticket collector) since we hadn’t yet paid our community fees (usually collected daily as we pass through the different community-controlled regions of the trek). Lots of frost on the tent this early but evenings haven’t been as cold as we feared. Beautiful views of the mountains as we packed up our tent and set off at 7:30 round Caruacocha Lake and up to the Tres Lagunas where we stopped at a viewpoint for lunch at 14K feet. Next came the steep 1800ft ascent to Siula Pass which we managed pretty well by going slow (baby steps during pass ascents are my new philosophy). We weren’t sure we’d have the energy or time before sunset to make it to Huayhuash campsite before sunset but we were feeling pretty decent after lots of post-pass snacking so we quickly descended the last couple miles and set up our tent at an official campground for the first time of the trek just as it started to hail on us. This is our first time experiencing what we call “tent city”, camping near about two dozen other tents (all of which look to be part of organized tours since they had giant kitchen tents brought in by mules). The benefit is that there are actual toilets here as well as sinks with non-potable running water to wash up._

<br/> **AUG 26 - Elephante Campground**
<br/> **7hrs, 8.4mi, 2700ft**
![Huayhuash-4](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1-1azKK9qPd7x4owbKmzdC-2H1wlfZvC_&sz=w1000)
_Toughest day yet with us going over the highest pass of the whole Huayhuash circuit (Trapecio pass @ 16,500ft). Started slow and steady the first 4 miles up to the pass, feeling pretty decent until we hit 16K where I made the stupid mistake of trying to wash some clothes in a nearby lake before lunch and constantly winded myself with this usually benign activity. After my laundry fiasco (but hey now I have some quasi clean clothes for the first time in 4 days!), the last 500ft up to the pass were rough but doable at a slow pace. Immediately hit with strong cold winds at the pass and for the next few miles as we descended down to our next camp through a barren rocky landscape dotted with deep blue and turquoise green lakes (Sara kept remarking it was like hiking on the moon… but with lakes I guess?). Got to Elephante camp at 5pm and set up our tent at yet another jaw-dropping site to eat our MREs watching the changing colors on the mountain. Freezing midnight bathroom trips are made slightly more bearable by the amazing starscape up here in the mountains._

<br/> **AUG 27 - Huayallpa Campground**
<br/> **6hrs, 10mi, 260ft**
![Huayhuash-5](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=15_dsUsdGnPoTrF5ek2fv7ajSWBKq6TEx&sz=w1000)
_Woke up this morning to discover that one of my Salomons had disappeared over the course of the night. So that was a fun way to wake up. Extensively walked around the campsite with one shoe on but failed to find my other shoe even with the help of four Peruvian guides from the neighboring camp. With our limited Spanish we surmised the culprit was probably one of the endemic foxes here. To help us out, one of the Peruvian men literally gave me the shoes off his feet (!!) so we could continue our trek since he had a backup pair and we arranged to meet in 5 days in Llamac so I could return them and pay him some money for his help. We started off down the valley (I’m now wearing sorta fitting hiking boots) and after about a mile, we saw one of the Peruvian guys (Julian) shouting+running after us - he had kept looking and found my shoe 200m from our tent carried by a fox!!! Really saved our trip since I’m not so sure how well my feet would have fared the next 5 days in ill-fitting hiking boots. Elated, we continued on hiking; we were looking forward to not having to ascend a pass today (first day of the trek) and instead did 10mi of downhill to the town of Huayallpa. Lots of interesting changing scenery and landscapes along the way. We ate lunch in a beautiful spot by the river and were joined by a dog who was surprisingly well-behaved despite desperately wanting to share our tuna wraps. Made it to Huayallpa round 4pm (earliest time yet), and set up camp by the other tents. A bunch of kids played a soccer game right next to our tent so I had to frequently deflect the ball away from our cooking ramen, averting disaster twice. Fun to watch though! Since Huayallpa was our only chance at real food on the trek, we wandered into town and met a woman who offered to cook pachamanca for us at her house. Two other trekkers ate with us and turns out they were from SF and had recently moved to Vancouver (same as us!) - what a small world. [Note: the fox photo above is not from the actual trek since I never saw the shoe-stealing sorro but an Andean fox I saw a week later while hiking to see Andean Condors]_

<br/> **AUG 28 - Gashpapampa Campground**
<br/> **7.5hrs, 9mi, 4200ft**
![Huayhuash-6](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1FSLKVoef3ojo4oNttyQntRT0W-GKsFHi&sz=w1000)
_On paper, today looked like the hardest day of the trek (definitely had never attempted 4000+ ft of elevation gain in a day, much less above 10K feet!) but we actually felt pretty good throughout. Biggest part is likely that we’re MUCH better acclimated now so we no longer lose our breath at every little thing. The day started with a long climb out of Huayallpa’s valley along a lush river and eventually transformed into the alpine pasture land we had grown accustomed to over this last week. Not too many animals today besides a troupe of inquisitive mules. Got a fun view of the giant hummingbird (largest in the world!) at one point and were delighted to see our friends the Andean Geese who let us know that we were back up at 15K feet after our Huayallpa night down at 11K. We picked up avocados, ramen, 2 eggs, and bananas on our way out of Huayallpa so that was basically our dinner at Gashpapampa (the bananas were a nice bonus and used for Nutella banana tortilla wraps)._

<br/> **AUG 29 - Jahuacocha Campground**
<br/> **6hrs, 6.8mi, 1700ft**
![Huayhuash-7](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1NOExYnhlYrWjFDrZa28RUHx7YIA9jCT_&sz=w1000)
_Possibly the prettiest day so far! Started out with a few hours of steep ascent to the pass (steep ascents are feeling SO much better/easier now that we’re more acclimated and know the technique is just to go super super slow). Jaw-dropping views throughout, especially up at the ridgeline where we stopped to eat lunch (getting sick of eating tuna+mayo tortilla wraps by now but luckily today I have an avocado so I get to eat an avocado tortilla wrap). Nice view of “tent city” from the ridgeline way way down there by the lake. Got in around 3:30pm (early for us) and were able to set up our tent and wander around taking photos of the cows and birds for a while. Ate our last MREs as the sunset made the nearby mountains glow pink._

<br/> **AUG 30 - Llamac**
<br/> **7hrs, 9.8mi, 1400ft**
![Huayhuash-8](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1nnHdLcpmpn-BGZXffhvjb0Htf8j510SK&sz=w1000)
_[Note: I actually have no notes from today since apparently I burned out on journaling by the last day so instead I’ve recapped what I remember.] This was our last day of the trek and despite having pretty significant mileage, it was a pretty easy day overall. Interesting to get back to cow pastureland that reminded us of the first two days of the trek. One memorable moment was being confronted on the trail by about a dozen unsheparded mules when clearly neither mules nor humans exactly knew what to do. Thankfully the mules are all super respectful and nice and literally climb up the trail shoulders to get out of your way. We arrived in the town of Llamac (which we passed through when getting dropped off on the first day) to find that there was a giant festival happening and learned from a local that the bus we were expecting to take wasn’t running due to the festival. So we found a cheap hostel in town, happily took a cold shower and ate a hot meal and got a ride from our hostel owner the next morning back to civilization._

Ollantaytambo & Cusco (Sep 2-9, 2025) 
======

Coming off of an amazing but exhausting 8 days in the Cordillera Huayhuash, we took 2 days off in Huaraz to do very little besides rest (and eat cake… looking back over my photos reveals that period to mostly be of Sara eating chocolate cake). After 2 days of real meals, decent sleep, and hot showers, we boarded our flight from Huaraz to Lima (necessary stopover on our way to the Sacred Valley) where we planned to spend a week with friends Cristina and Brennan who were visiting us in Peru from NYC!

![Ollantaytambo-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Z10tcH_SjqtRnCBLjivhzMBOuv4YzGbp&sz=w1000)
_Sara and Cristina walking around Ollantaytambo market stalls_

We had ended up on the same flight as Cristina and Brennan after our Lima connection so we were able to share a private taxi for the 2hrs from the Cusco airport to Ollantaytambo (a process that was weirdly confusing for such a major airport). We settled in to our hotel in Ollantaytambo and wandered around the cobblestone streets of the ancient Incan town before finding dinner where I finally got to try alpaca served sizzling on a hot stone.

![Ollantaytambo-2](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1c7NyhA6K0EHtTeyiIEQg-8pWcaANI7dG&sz=w1000)
_The four of us on our Abra Malaga birding trip_

Since Cristina and Brennan are also birders (and arguably our only friends who would want to go on birding trips with us…), Brennan had booked two guided birding tours for the week they were there. The first was a full day of birding around Abra Malaga to see high elevation Andean birds and some specific endemics. Unfortunately it rained all morning (never great for birds but does make for some fun shots) but the inclement weather ended up making for one of our more memorable birding experiences: since Abra Malaga pass is all the way up at 14,000ft, as we got closer to the pass the rainy weather turned into full on snow (something our birding guides said rarely happened up there) and we opted to stop at a weirdly wonderful coffee shop up at 14,000ft to escape from the snow. The barista, a young guy who clearly was passionate about Peruvian cocoa and coffee, took the time to teach us about the different local coffee beans and cocoa pods that their coffee shop used (translated to us by Cristina who’s fluency in Spanish came in handy time and time again over the week) as we warmed up and listened to jazz.

![Ollantaytambo-3](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1YcvPs2JyVGwBUhjP1Ny3XT_2FlTnGh9G&sz=w1000)
_We weren’t expecting snow in the Sacred Valley_

After our brief pit stop, we continued over to the west side of the pass where the weather improved and so did the birding. Made for a great day overall (46 species total) largely thanks to how great our guides were. We learned that they had only recently started this birding company, [Birding Peru Trips](https://www.birdingperutrips.com/) on their own and that most birding guides (including them) historically worked for US or UK owned tour groups so check them out if you’re interested in birding around Cusco to support locally owned tours! Some highlights from Abra Malaga included the Urubamba Antpitta (first antpitta!), Sword-billed Hummingbird, Pearled Treerunner, Creamy-crested Spinetail, Cuzco Brushfinch, Scarlet-bellied Mountain Tanager, and Chestnut-breasted Mountain Finch (you can check out my photos of these birds and others from the Andes [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-09-09-portfolio-15-peru-andes)).

![Ollantaytambo-4](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1TQgN2VpTkWG5FFfMY1vHs8OCyPZ0a5ri&sz=w1000)
_The snow also made for one of my favorite bird shots of the trip - a male Andean gull doing a courtship display circling around an (un)interested female._

If I remember right, it’s basically a federal crime to travel to Peru and not visit Machu Picchu so, of course, we had set aside a day to spend at this UNESCO World Heritage site. While Machu Picchu itself is an amazing, unforgettable experience, the trip to and from this archaeological site is much less fun. Out of 6 months traveling in 9 countries in Asia, the process to get to Machu Picchu was probably the most crowded, touristy, and among the most confusing (compounded by the fact that the entry tickets you pre-purchase are only valid for a 1hr window that you can’t miss). Our day started around 4am to catch the train from Ollantaytambo to Agua Calientes and then one of the many buses up to the entry site of Machu Picchu where we arrived around 8:30am. Complaining aside, Machu Picchu is absolutely worth the visit and really is deserving of its title as one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

_Classic selfie at Machu Picchu_

We had decided to get tickets that included a 3hr hike around Huayna Picchu to see the Gran Caverna and Temple of the Moon which quickly took us away from the crowds at the main ruins and allowed us to get a sense of the flora and fauna that surrounded this ancient Incan civilization. 

![Ollantaytambo-6](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=18bmmE7I2bac1LktSpB3Gq9PqEqeQps5z&sz=w1000)
_Shot from our hike to the Gran Cavern_

We spent another hour after our hike continuing to explore the central ruins of Machu Picchu, admiring and learning about the amazing stonework that characterizes the Incan civilization (from our self-appointed Lonely Planet educated tour guide Sara). The ruins of Machu Picchu were constructed using a technique called “ashlar masonry” in which huge stones blocks were meticulously cut and precisely fit together all without the use of any mortar (this is especially apparent in the more important and ceremonial buildings). It’s difficult to really describe how impressive this is, especially considering the immense size and variety of geometric stone shapes, without seeing it for yourself.

![Ollantaytambo-7](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1FipxIkoQA6eVBTL2CTWoYM6Hw1vHY0Ww&sz=w1000)
_Saying goodbye to Machu Picchu_

The next day we said goodbye to Ollantaytambo and set off for Cusco in a private car. One real benefit of traveling as a group of 4 (instead of just the two of us) is the flexibility/cost-effectiveness that hiring a private car provides. As a result we were able to stop at a hummingbird sanctuary that Cristina had found where we spent an hour walking around and photographing the amazing trainbearers and sword-billed hummingbirds (only bird whose bill is longer than its body!). A few days later we hired the same driver to take us around all day so we could to a loop of some of the famous archaeological sites in the region (e.g. Tipon, Pikillacta, and Pisac) and visit another hummingbird sanctuary (this time to see the Bearded Mountaineer which you can see among my bird shots [here]((https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-09-09-portfolio-15-peru-andes))).

_Visiting the famous Pisac archaeological site with its rounded agricultural terraces_

Most of our time in Cusco was spent walking around, eating, and visiting markets (particularly enjoyed Mercado San Pedro). Peru, and especially Cusco, is famous for its alpaca wool clothing and textiles so we were all intent on finding some gifts to pick up before Cristina and Brennan flew back to NYC. Between the official alpaca wool stores (Kuna, Patapampa, Sol Alpaca, …) and the market stalls (which all dubiously claimed to sell top quality 100% baby alpaca wool…) there are about a million options for alpaca wool shopping in Cusco so that enjoyably filled up a large amount of our walking around time. Cusco is an immensely walkable city and it’s amazing to see the integration of ancient Incan walls with modern buildings as you stroll down the narrow cobblestone streets. One touristy standout which is definitely worth the visit was Qorikancha, the most sacred temple in the 15<sup>th</sup> century Incan empire which in its day was adorned with massive amounts of gold and silver. When the Spanish conquistadors invaded in the 16<sup>th</sup> century, they destroyed much of the ancient temple and built the Convent of Santo Domingo on its foundations resulting in a remarkable superposition of the two extremely different architectural design styles. Aside from Machu Picchu, Qorikancha is one of the best places to see the amazing precision of Incan ashlar masonry.

For one of our days based in Cusco, we set out on another guided birding trip to Apurimac Canyon where we hoped to see the Andean condors, one of the three most sacred animals in Incan mythology and intimately associated with Incan spirituality around life and death (the condor represents the Upper World, the puma represents the Middle World, and the serpent represents the Under World). It’s also among the largest birds in the world, with a wingspan of over 10ft long (Wikipedia has its wingspan docked at the 6th largest of any bird). We set off on a long drive with our same birding guides from Abra Malaga, driving ~3hrs to get to the start of the hike to the condor lookout (Mirador del Condor). I should also add that the last section of this drive was the single sketchiest stretch of driving Sara and I have experienced since we started traveling over a year ago; the narrow gravel road barely clung to the side of the mountain and had a sheer thousand foot drop off on the other side. Kudos to our great driver who got us there safely (though it was disconcerting to learn that the road was new and he’d never driven on it before!). We hiked for about an hour from the trailhead to the lookout point and waited for the temperature to climb a bit - condors ride thermals, and will reliably take off from their roosts in the cliffside to take advantage of the pressure differentials and soar through Apurimac Canyon every day. We saw a total of 6 of them (one adult and 5 juveniles), including an incredibly memorable flyby by one of the condors who came within 20-30 feet of us to check us out. It’s amazing how relatively normal-sized they look from a distance and how scary large they appear as soon as they get close. Never thought I’d see a wild bird that large so close up!

After a week in the Sacred Valley, and something close to ~100 bird species seen, Cristina and Brennan had to fly home to NYC. On their last day we invariably did some more shopping for last minute alpaca wool gifts before saying goodbye (I even found a nice scarf which is impressive given how much I hate shopping for clothing for myself). Next up for us was 3 days into the Amazon Basin by way of Manu Road!

Manu Road & Manu National Park (Sep 10-12, 2025)

Ever since starting to plan our trip to South America, we’d been especially excited about visiting the deep Amazonian rainforesst, most famously accessible in Peru via Manu National Park or the Tambopata Research Center. However, once we arrived in Lima and started looking into it we realized this was probably unrealistic due to the limited number of permits (in the case of the deeper sections of Manu National Park) and the exceedingly high cost (in the case of Tambopata Research Center). Further research taught us that we’d have better luck at our price point in Bolivia so we instead decided to plan a trip along Peru’s Manu Road  (and spend a week in the primary Amazonian rainforest in Madidi National Park when we got to Bolivia). We came across a whirlwind guided birding trip that would take us from Cusco along the legendary Manu road into the outer sections of the national park for 2 nights (the deeper areas of Manu are the more restrictive and pricier ones). While very different ecologically from the primary Amazonian rainforest, among birders, Manu Road is an even more legendary destination since its dramatic altitudinal gradient transects multiple birding habitats and provides unparalleled biodiversity; while ornithologists argue about the single most biodiverse birding hotspot, Manu is invariably on the shortlist (and often contended to be the winner) with more than 1000 species identified on this single stretch of road. Over the course of our 3 days birding in Manu, we saw a jaw-dropping 151 new species, **by far** the most productive 3 days of birding we’ve had, and pushing us both over our sabbatical goal of getting our life lists above 1000 bird species!

_Birding along Manu road with our guide Simon_

We got picked up by our driver and birding guide (Simon) in Cusco at 6am and drove a few hours to the entrance of Manu National Park up near Acjanaco Pass at ~4000m where we started our first whirlwind day of birding (it should be noted that while our entire trip was 3 days, most Manu road birding trips are 10-14!). Over the course of the day, we drove from the high Andean Puna (>3500m) through the temperate+sub-tropical cloud forest (2000-3500m) to the foothill rainforest (500-2000m) and finally to the Amazonian lowland rainforest (<500m) where our ecolodge was located. The most famous section of Manu Road is the orchid- and bromeliad-filled cloud forest which is also home to the Andean Cock-of-the-Rock (Peru’s national bird and a contender for strangest bird I’ve ever seen), a variety of quetzals, tropical tanagers, toucanets, and amazingly colorful hummingbirds. We finished this first day of birding and arrived at our ecolodge (Guadalupe Lodge) an hour or so after dark which gave us the chance to even see a pair of ladder-tailed nightjars.

We spent the second day of birding entirely in the Amazonian rainforest starting right around dawn at 5:30am (while Sara seems fine rolling out of bed and starting to bird, I usually got up 15min early to chug an instant coffee in the dining lodge). We spent the first couple hours of the morning walking along the main road to the lodge with our guide Simon (roadside birding is infinitely more productive+easier than deep jungle birding) where we logged a checklist of 49 species all before breakfast! Highlights were the flocks of parrots, parakeets, and macaws flying overhead, trying to catch glimpses through the brush of the elusive antbirds and antshrikes, calling out the amazingly weird Red-billed Scythebill, seeing the hundreds of Oropendola basket nests hanging from trees everywhere in the rainforest (and hearing their ubiquitous electronic/door-creaking calls), and all the many rainforest tanagers (birds I love but hate to photograph because of how difficult they are as subjects).

After a quick breakfast, we set off again this time up a trail into the jungle for a 4hr hike into the deeper rainforest to try to spot the more elusive endemics. Consistent with all our previous adventures with jungle birding, it’s slow-going, hot/humid, and frustrating since you can hear a million interesting birds but see virtually nothing. In this case, we hugely benefited from our extremely experienced birding guide who was born in one of the communities in Manu National Park and had been a professional birder there for over 20 years (and had a life list of >3300 species). He was able to recognize and call out species after species for us (though in the rainforest this often amounted to mere seconds of sighting of each bird species before it would fly back into the deeper jungle). He was especially keen on finding for us the rarer endemic species that can’t be found anywhere else (e.g. antshrikes, antwrens, jacamars, flatbills, and endemic warblers).

We continued on to a nearby hummingbird garden where I took about 1000 photos of which maybe ~5% were worth keeping. As I’m new to bird photography (and photography in general), I’m learning that hummingbird photography is a completely different beast than regular bird photography and definitely needs its own dedicated settings (which I have not set up…). By luck and hours of sifting through photos taken at high shutter speed, I managed to capture some fun ones of hummingbirds in flight I’m happy with. We hiked from the hummingbird garden through some jungle to a nearby lagoon where we saw the mythical ancient hoatzins as well as an elusive crake which I’ve wanted to see ever since I read Margaret Atwood’s Oryx & Crake even before I got into birding (you can see these birds and other shots from our Manu trip [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-09-12-portfolio-16-peru-manu)).

For our last day of the Manu birding trip we got up again at dawn for a quick breakfast then drove to Bambu Lodge where they had feeding stations set up for tanagers (which are notoriously hard to photograph). Before even reaching the feeding stations, we spotted a Common Potoo, a relative of the owl, which has some of the most amazing camouflage I’d ever seen. We then started the long drive back up through the cloud forest and on to Cusco, taking dozens of quick birding stops along the way. We arrived back in Cusco long after dark and got dropped off at our new hostel to finally get some rest and start the long process of sifting through the thousands of photos from Manu Road.

Cusco, Puno, and off to Bolivia (Sep 13-15, 2025) 
======

After 3 days birding in Manu National Park all I really wanted to do was sleep but there were still some things in Cuzco that Sara and I wanted to do. So, through a combination of coffee and coca tea, we mustered the energy to check the last few things off our Cuzco list. For one, we spent a few hours at the Regional Historical Museum of Cusco, housed in the birthplace and former home of the famous Spanish-Inca chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega, where we learned more about the region’s Spanish-colonial history and ultimately successful struggle for independence.

We also trekked up the million stairs to Sacsayhuamán, an Incan citadel and UNESCO World Heritage archaeological site, where we walked around for a few hours learning about the megalithic stone walls constructed in a defensive zigzag shape (the teeth of the puma whose shape Cusco was designed as). Sacsayhuamán contains some of the premier examples of the incredible Incan stonework I’ve already mentioned but as an added bonus, some of its immense polished stone blocks weigh a massive 100 tons!

Finally, on our last evening we visited the Centro de Arte Nativo which puts on a daily evening performance of traditional Andean music and dancing (the elaborate and numerous costumes were particularly interesting). Before heading off to Puno, our quick stopover on the way Bolivia, we shipped most of our trekking gear back to Canada (thank you Lara and Sara!) so we wouldn’t have to lug our tent and sleeping bags from Huayhuash around for the next two months. We caught a long bus to Puno, checked into a hostel near the bus station where Sara quickly befriended the young daughter of the owner (who happily came up with a game where she crawled through Sara’s legs repeatedly as we were checking in). We had originally thought of spending a few days in Puno to check out the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca but were still so exhausted from the last few weeks of non-stop activity in Peru that we bee-lined it to Copacobana, Bolivia where we intended to spend a couple days in a nice hotel doing nothing but decompressing.
