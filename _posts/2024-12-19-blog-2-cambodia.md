4 weeks in Cambodia
======

Our first stop on our extended Southeast Asia trip was Cambodia since it holds a special place in Sara’s heart (Sara and her family actually lived in Cambodia for 3 years from 1996-1999!), and we had just visited back in February so were familiar with the country/currency/language. We intentionally did minimal planning so we could be spontaneous with our travel decisions and ended up spending close to a month in Cambodia.

Phnom Penh (Nov 23-27, 2024)
======

_Streetview of Phnom Penh and its ubiquitous tuktuks_

We flew into Phnom Penh and spent a couple days exploring the capital of Cambodia. Since we’d just visited 6 months ago, we were able to skip some of the touristy must-sees (i.e. Royal Palace, National Museum, Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, …), and focus on recovering from jet lag and resetting our circadian rhythms after 36hrs of traveling. This time we picked a hotel in Boeung Kong Kong (BKK), a neighborhood right next to Russian Market which is one of our favorite places to wander around and get street food in Phnom Penh.

_A view of Russian Market at night_

For a city of ~2.5 million people, Phnom Penh always feels surprisingly walkable and _tuktuks_ will take you anywhere in the city you can’t walk to for about $1 USD. For the most part, we spent our few days here wandering around the riverfront, getting stupidly good Cambodian iced coffees, and seeking out good rooftop restaurants/bars to enjoy the sunset over the Mekong River.

Battambang (Nov 27-28, 2024)
======

Instead of the regular bus lines, we decided to take the train from Phnom Penh to Battambang which I highly recommend. The journey is slow and scenic (taking about 8 hours) and mostly ridden by locals, offering a great way to see the Cambodian countryside as we made our way westward across the country to Battambang.

_View of the Sangker River from town_

Despite being passed over by most travelers to Cambodia, Battambang was one of our favorite short stops. Known for its colonial architecture, vibrant arts scene, and beautiful countryside, I’d recommend visiting for its sunset riverside strolls alone.

_Cooking class at Coconut Lyly’s Restaurant_

On the morning of our second day there, we took a cooking class at Coconut Lyly where the owner/chef first took us to the local market to pick up ingredients, and then taught us how to make chicken amok (amok is the national dish of Cambodia), vegetable spring rolls, and green mango salad. 

![Battambang-extra](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1TgB_Ki1s_ywZto2jZaeVu342PVof48c8&sz=w1000)
_Phare circus show_

We spent the evening seeing a show at [Phare Circus](www.pharecircus.org), a circus and social enterprise started in Battambang. Phare was started in 1994 by 9 young men coming home from a refugee camp after the Khmer Rouge regime who, believing in the power of art therapy, chose to use circus and theater to showcase uniquely Cambodian stories. Proceeds from the circus shows go on to support over 1200 Cambodian students studying theater, arts, music, and circus, as well as extensive outreach programs in the community. We enjoyed this show and learning about the association so much that we saw another of their shows in Siem Reap where graduates from the Battambang Phare circus school that want to continue professionally go on to develop their careers in circus arts.

Tonle Sap (Nov 29-30, 2024)
======

_Boat trip up the Sangker River towards the floating villages of Tonle Sap_

When planning our trip, we were excited to visit one of the floating villages on Cambodia’s Great Lake, the Tonle Sap - a UNESCO designated Biosphere Reserve, and experience the unique way of life in this part of Cambodia but we’re unsure how to do it in a more immersive, authentic way. After some research, we came across an opportunity to do a homestay with Hoksan and his family who run the non-profit organization [Prek Toal Moving Ahead](https://prektoal-movingahead.org/) to support the sustainable development of the local community and protecting the way of life in floating villages.

_Paddling around the floating villages with Hoksan’s aunt_

After a few hours spent boating up the Sangker River, we arrived at Hoksan’s village where every house, market, temple, and school floats on Tonle Sap (most are built on wooden rafts and barrels), a necessity given that the water level changes ~30 feet between the annual wet and dry season! Hoksan and his aunt showed us around the village by paddle boat: we visited the local Wat to see the monks, stopped by the middle school to meet a grade 3 class (who were very entertained to pepper us with questions), and checked out a freshwater crocodile farm before heading off to see the sunset over the lake.

_A selfie Hoksan took of us all on the boat on our way to the birding sanctuary_

Hoksan is also an avid bird guide (one of the reasons we were so excited to homestay with him and his family) so on our second day there we got up 2 hours before dawn to boat to the Prek Toal Bird Sanctuary. We spent the morning in a treehouse where a Cambodian ranger lives year-round to monitor the population levels of the local bird populations and prevent poaching. Saw a staggering amount of painted storks, spot-billed pelicans, and even the greater and lesser adjutants which I think are truly the ugliest/creepiest birds we’ve sighted so far [(eBird checklist)](https://ebird.org/checklist/S204027758). I was also able to capture a shot of the pied kingfisher to send to Hoksan who wanted to hang it up in his home since it’s his favorite bird and he lost his camera off the side of a boat birding last year!

Siem Reap (Dec 1-9, 2024)
======

_Sara at Siem Reap’s main market_

As the jumping off point for visited Angkor Wat and the surrounding temples, Siem Reap is definitely the most visited city in Cambodia by foreigners. Thankfully, we timed our visit for early December to miss the mass of tourists that visit around the Christmas holidays so the city (and even the Angkor temples!) felt relatively relaxed and peaceful during our time there. We met some travelers who only spent 1 night in Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat (which seems crazy rushed) but we decided to travel slow and opted to spent more than a week there to have time to see more of the “lesser” temple complexes surrounding Angkor Wat (e.g. Bayon Temple, Angkor Thom, Bantey Srei, Kbal Spean, and Koh Ker temples). We actually really enjoyed the vibe of Siem Reap in general (though we mostly avoided the iconic Pub Street party scene), and especially liked the variety of good food options - favorites were the street food by the night art market, Wild (which focuses exclusively on spring rolls and creative cocktails), and The Sugar Palm (where Gordon Ramsay went to learn to cook fish amok!).

![10-Siem-Reap](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1Golk1lfMBs7DQPxwgJ8nKnnSgHm2hBkS&sz=w1000)
_Our visit to Angkor Wat_

Before visiting Angkor Wat, we spent the day at the [National Angkor Museum](https://angkornationalmuseum.com/) to learn about the history and culture of the ancient Khmer Empire, something I definitely recommend - especially if you do a self-guided visit to the temples like we did.

![9-Siem-Reap](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1x3PsUEQ6Sx0gOMAuuhJy8oD1Rn4in2st&sz=w1000)
_Lunch stop after mountain biking all morning from Siem Reap to Angkor Wat_

We spent the next two days renting mountain bikes and biking around the different temple complexes. We were pleasantly surprised by how few tourists there were at Angkor Wat (we planned our visit to arrive right after the sunrise rush) and actually ended up spending more than 5 hours there alone doing our best to identify the different Hindu deities in the enormous bas reliefs that occupy the major walls of the temple (our favorite was the mural depicting the [Churning of the Sea of Milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samudra_Manthana)).

![12-Siem-Reap](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1968qIaIZ9_exXTQ1_31Jhlyj-_ObvQzU&sz=w1000)
_A view of Bayon Temple and the smiling Buddha face_

The next day we biked directly to the walled city of Angkor Thom, the political and spiritual hub of the Khmer Empire in the 12th century under King Jayavarman VII, to explore the 9 km<sup>2</sup> complex. At the heart of Angkor Thom sits Bayon Temple, famous for its 54 towers each adorned with four serenely smiling faces (thought to either be of King Jayavarman VII or the Buddha of Compassion, Avalokiteshvara).

_One of many portraits I shot of crab-eating macaques_

One highlight of Angkor Thom that sets it apart from some of the other surrounding Angkor complexes is the many crab-eating macaques that populate the ancient city. We definitely got distracted from visiting the temples and spent a couple hours photographing monkey behavior instead (including one juvenile monkey that spent 30 minutes holding and playing with a giant toad like a toy).

![11-Siem-Reap](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1pGzSTM1gJIf__5eLvlYOVTDlZ9gvZ4zT&sz=w1000)
_Prasat Pram at Koh Ker_

Out of all the temples visited, our favorites were probably the overgrown jungle ones (specifically Ta Prohm, Prasat Pram, and Beng Mealea). Reconstruction has been intentionally avoided at many of these temples allowing you to see how centuries of vegetative growth have become intertwined with the ancient temple ruins.

![14-Siem-Reap](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1JbU1MLAYcLOjDRS-j8cNgVkbbs1lCHus&sz=w1000)
_Our bird guide from the Cambodia Bird Guide Association_

These temples are also teeming with bird life and we spent a day with a local guide from the [Cambodia Bird Guide Association](https://www.birdguideasso.org/), a non-profit that provides birding and natural heritage tours and is focused on supporting wildlife conservation efforts in Cambodia. One of my goals while unemployed and traveling is to work on developing my skills at bird photography - you can check out my first attempts at photographing Cambodian birds [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/998-portfolio-2-cambodia-2/)!

Kampong Cham & Krachech (Dec 9-12, 2024)
======

After more than a week in Siem Reap, we made our way back eastward and stopped in Kampong Cham to recharge for two nights. Kampong Cham is nestled right on the bank of the Mekong River, and, despite being a relatively large town, has virtually no tourists. We spent our time here vegetating in our hotel room and taking sunset strolls along the river before striking out for a more active week in Krachech and then Virachey National Park.

An older Australian expat we met in Kampong Cham recommended we stay at his friend Dary’s guesthouse in Krachech when we visited, so we booked two nights there. Dary is a Cambodian woman who was the first female _tuktuk_ driver in Krachech, a job she held for 15 years in an extremely hostile male-dominated profession before moving on to run a guesthouse with her husband. Big shout-out to Dary’s Guesthouse which also had the best pizza we ate in all of Cambodia (which Dary makes from scratch!).

_Kayaking to see the endangered Irrawaddy river dolphins_

The main draw of Krachech for visitors is the chance to see the critically endangered Irrawaddy river dolphins. Modern estimates put the entire Mekong population of these freshwater river dolphins at less than 100! We hired a kayaking guide, Pho Ream, and rented kayaks to go see these endangered animals and, after a few hours kayaking, spotted a dozen or so whose pod was feeding by some local fisherman.

Banlung & Virachey National Park (Dec 13-18, 2024)
======

From the get-go we had planned to finish our time in Cambodia up in Banlung (Ratanakiri Province) before crossing the border up to Laos so we could visit the jungles in Virachey National Park. Since it’s pretty off the beaten track, most visitors don’t make it to Banlung but it’s definitely worth the visit if you enjoy outdoor activities and nature. We rented mountain bikes our first day there and spent the day biking ~35km around the iconic red dusty roads to visit the big waterfalls (Cha Ong and Kachanh waterfalls) and the nearby Yeak Laom Lake.

![17-Virachey](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1oP1RDPAkPtI_zCv1HV8ifF7mtGdMG_0M&sz=w1000)
_Jungle trek through Virachey National Park_

Luckily, the eco-lodge we stayed in was just down the street from [Parrot Tours](https://jungletrekkingcambodia.com/), a jungle trek operator offering a number of options into Virachey National Park. We booked a 3D/2N trek and were joined by Dorian and Litou, a French guy and Dutch girl in their twenties who were also backpacking through Southeast Asia for 6 months. After a drive, a ferry, and a 1hr ride on the back of a moto on treacherous terrain, we made it to the edge of Virachey National Park and began our hike in with an English speaking guide and two indigenous guides from a local tribe.

_Dorian and I lugging a bamboo log from the grove down to our campsite_

On the second day, we hiked all morning until we reached a bamboo grove close to the river where we would set up camp and our guides got to work cutting down 16 twenty foot bamboo logs with machetes to use to make a raft. We spent the next few hours lugging bamboo logs back to our campsite so our guides could fashion them into a raft to float back to our starting point the next morning. We spent the evening going on a night hike to see jungle spiders and hunt frogs which our guides grilled on bamboo sticks on the fire (surprisingly tasty!).

_Sara, Litou, and Dorian inspecting the bamboo haul_

One thing this trip impressed upon me was the absolute versatility and utility of bamboo. Not only did our guides build a raft that the 7 of us would use to float 10km down the river on our third day, but bamboo was also used as rope, firewood, a cooking receptacle to make soup in, as cups for local rice wine, and as support to hang our hammocks from.

![20-Virachey](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1OV4xmzOZd4egGmjcnjrejvYW_forDHdH&sz=w1000)
_Floating down the river on the bamboo raft_

On our last day, we stuffed our packs into giant plastic bags and loaded up the raft to float downriver back to our starting point. Sara and I spent the journey trying to ID interesting birds along the river and teaching the group about the common species in Ratanakiri Province. We returned to Banlung for one more night to shower after 3 days in the jungle and then boarded our bus for Laos!
