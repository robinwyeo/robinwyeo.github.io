Last stop after 6 months of travel: Japan!
======

Japan is so incredibly dense with people, culture, and history that, right off the bat, we decided we would stick entirely to central Honshu for the two weeks of our visit. We split our time in Japan between metropolitan Tokyo and the Japanese Alps; despite spending a full half of our trip there in Tokyo, I feel like we barely scratched the surface!

Tokyo (May 20-22, 2025) 
======

For our first visit to Tokyo, we decided to stay near Ueno Park so we’d be close to the Tokyo National Museum and far away from the chaos of downtown. We flew into Narita International Airport and took the skyliner train 1 hour into the city to check into our tiny hotel room. Somehow Tokyo didn’t rank as the smallest hotel room we had on our trip (that honor goes to a place in Chiang Mai, Thailand!) but it definitely had the highest average cost per night of any city we visited.

_Exploring Tokyo at night_

We started off our first day in Tokyo by visiting Ueno Park and stopping to eat cold soba tempura noodles and soufflé pancakes before heading to the Tokyo National Museum. We spent the afternoon there learning about Japanese history, and stayed until closing time (we now have enough experience with museums to know that 1-5pm is about our upper bound even when it’s a fantastic museum like the Tokyo National Museum where you could theoretically spend 20+ hours exploring without ever retracting your steps).

We spent the next morning following a walking tour from the Lonely Planet Guide, and the rest of the day wandering around various neighborhoods in the Eastern part of Tokyo. Quasi-aimless wandering is probably my favorite thing to do in a new city which explains why our daily step count has nearly doubled since we started traveling. We walked through Ueno Park again, this time finding a pop-up pottery market set up there where we lost about an hour. It’s been a bit of a struggle being around all of the amazing pottery while we traveled and not allowing ourselves to buy any (since we don’t currently have a home to store anything). However, every once in a while (like here!) we make an exception and get something nice for our future place. We continued our day walking through Yanaka cemetery, and visited Tennoji Temple along the way to [Senso-ji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sens%C5%8D-ji). Senso-ji is Tokyo’s oldest (founded in 645 AD) and most famous temple, and is worth the visit just to take in the amazing Japanese archiecture in spite of the massive crowds and touristy vibe.

Togakushi (May 23-25, 2025) 
======

_Sara at the ryokan in Togakushi_

After a couple days in Tokyo, we took the train to Nagano, then a bus to the small town of Togakushi in the mountains where we stayed at a [ryokan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan), a traditional Japanese inn, complete with communal bath, where you sleep in a room with a tatami mat floor and futons. We’d picked Togakushi to visit since it seemed like a quiet place in the country that was supposed to have good access to forests and birding. Once we got there it became pretty clear that Togakushi was primarily a ski town; during the summer, the town itself felt pretty sleepy, with most visitors being Japanese families visiting its historic shrines. Besides its shrines, Togakushi is famous for its soba noodles, so of course we ate soba every day while there.

We spent our first afternoon in Togakushi exploring the hiking trails around town to look for birds in the rain. What we didn’t know when we set out was that there would be LITERALLY nothing open after 5:30pm in Togakushi so when we arrived back in town from our hike, every restaurant had already closed. Desperate, we walked a half mile out of town to an Italian-Japanese fusion restaurant that was supposed to be open but was instead currently under renovation. Luckily, Google Maps told us there was one other restaurant on the opposite side of town that was ostensibly still open. When we got there, we discovered it was a high-end Japanese ski chalet restaurant (replete with antlers on the wall and giant display bottles of Veuve Cliquot) that only seats by reservation. Thankfully, the owner, a dapper older Japanese man wearing a tuxedo shirt and bow tie, seeing that we clearly had just spent the day out in the mountains and looked desperate, took pity on us and said that although he couldn’t seat us for a full tasting, he’d be willing to prepare some sushi for us for 2000 yen. We happily agreed and sat way in the back, aware of how underdressed we were for the vibe of the restaurant. Regardless, the owner/chef and his wife were extremely kind and welcoming the whole night, and brought us out an assortment of sushi for dinner. A lot of it was not really my thing (it was a first for me trying seared raw octopus, cuddlefish ngiri, and sea slug ngiri for example) but we were sure to finish every last piece of the meal they had so kindly prepared for us. Without any English to communicate, they brought us out an English book of fish identification and highlighted the pages for each of our ngiri pieces so we’d know what we were eating!

_Sushi dinner in Togakushi_

We got up early the following morning and walked a few miles up the road to the botanical gardens which I’d hoped would be a good birding spot. Sure enough, that’s where we found **all** the birders. In most good birding spots we’d visited, the people on the hiking trails are usually some amalgam of backpacker, family daytripper, casual tourist, birder, or nature enthusiast, but the Togakushi Botanical Gardens were one of those rare places where almost every single person was obviously there for the birds (the only other places that come to mind on our trip were Fraser’s Hill in Malaysia and Mt Kinabalu in Borneo). We showed up around 8am and literally had to rush ahead of a giant group of ~30 birders on a guided tour before they scared off all the birds. The Togakushi Botanical Gardens were indeed a great birding spot and we saw >20 species that morning including 3 new woodpeckers (Japanese Pygmy Woodpecker, White-backed Woodpecker, and Great Spotted Woodpecker) whose noises filled the forest.

Since we’d been caught in the rain yesterday, we were worried about the weather in Togakushi but luckily managed to make it to a soba shop on one of the shrine trails right before the early afternoon downpour set in. We put away our binoculars and cameras, and spent the rest of the afternoon hiking up to the Upper Shrine of Togakushi. Having learned our lesson from the night before, we stopped back into town at 5pm to grab dinner at the one cafe still open (soba cake for desert!). The cafe was run by an elderly couple in the kitchen while their mid-40s son and his wife dealt with customers; even though no one spoke any English, the atmosphere was cozy and warm, and everyone was super welcoming and friendly. This was a nice change from Tokyo where we’d found most people to be pretty unwelcoming and curt (we tried not to take it too personally and remind ourselves that if it were Brooklyn, NYC it’s exactly what we’d expect!). However, it did put into perspective just how friendly so many of the places we’d visited over the last 6 months truly were.

Matsumoto & Kamikochi (May 25-30, 2025) 
======

Besides Tokyo, our main destination in Japan was Matsumoto, a charming city in Nagano Prefecture, famous for its historic castle and as a gateway to the Japanese Alps (the real reason we wanted to visit).

![Matsumoto-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1j5fRfHCTEeSMa6H9pU7qKG8Gbb__1f71&sz=w1000)
_Matsumoto Castle_

Matsumoto is an easily walkable city, and we got ourselves a hotel a short distance away from the famous [Matsumoto Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsumoto_Castle) built ~500 years ago, one of only five castles in Japan designated as a National Treasure. Although not necessarily a must-visit, we spent an interesting hour or two walking around the moat and up the 6 stories of Matsumoto Castle where there were exhibits on the castle’s construction, ancient weaponry, and how the introduction of firearms changed the face of samurai warfare (the castle has some of the best examples of ancient firearms in Japan).

We walked through some of Matsumoto’s famous shopping streets (Narawate Shopping Street memorably was overflowing with frog statues everywhere) and had tonkotsu for lunch - Japan is so famous for its food we were of course determined to try as many of the famous Japanese dishes during our two weeks here as we could. Since Sara was feeling a bit sick (she caught what had me under the weather in Togakushi), she rested back at the hotel for the afternoon while I visited the [Matsumoto Timepiece Museum](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/14/fashion/clocks-timepiece-museum-matsumoto-japan.html), a delightful 3-story museum filled with Western and Japanese clocks and watches, including many with unusual and exotic horological movements.

If you visit Matsumoto, an absolute must-visit is the [Matsumoto City Museum of Art](https://matsumoto-artmuse.jp/en/) whose feature exhibit “Yayoi Kusama: The place for my soul” was absolutely incredible. Yayoi Kusama is a world-renowned visual artist born in Matsumoto almost a century ago (she’s 96 and still creating art!) whose pieces surreally fuse pop art and psychedelic abstraction - they’re also often easily recognizable by her obsession with polka dots! Some of her most famous pieces are the “infinity rooms” which cleverly use mirrors and LEDs to create the illusion of being in an infinite sparkling space.

The next morning we got up before dawn to catch a 5:30am bus to Kamikochi National Park, the main reason we had based ourselves in nearby Matsumoto. We spent the morning birding up and down Azusa River from the visitor center down to the southern trailheads, enjoying the backdrop of the Japanese Alps and the crystal clear water of the river (the mountains of Kamikochi reminded me of the Canadian Rockies and the Swiss Alps - high praise!).

Once we’d exhausted the good morning birding hours, we had lunch at a nearby chalet and struck out to hike up Mt Yakedake, an active volcano whose fuming vents you could see (and eventually smell) the further you got up the trail. We spent a couple hours hiking ~2000ft up towards the volcanic summit, scrambling over snow patches and ice fields, and navigating narrow rickety ladders up the steeper/sketchier portions. Despite the incredibly steep grade, we passed a couple in their mid-70s who, though moving slowly, were handling the trail no problem. One interesting thing about hiking in Kamikochi was the realization that Japanese hikers all wear little bells on their gear to warn off the bears! Unfortunately a storm was rolling in and we had to turn around at the secondary summit, just a half mile and a few hundred of elevation shy of the real nearby summit. Still totally worth it. Also my first day of reaching 40K steps!

Using Matsumoto as a basecamp, we spent our last day in the region daytripping out to the post town Narai in the Kiso Valley of Nagano Prefecture, once an important stop on the Nakasendō, a historic Edo-period trade route connecting Kyoto and Tokyo. Due to its status as one of Japan’s Nationally Designated Architectural Preservation Sites, Narai remains a beautiful example of what an Edo-period post town would look like, and tourists and Japanese alike flock there daily to walk down the historic streets retracing the steps of Edo-period samurai.

For our last night in Matsumoto, we stopped in a **tiny** sushi place where we were served an 8-piece omakase meal. Despite there only being two French guys at the counter when we arrived we were told it would be a 40min wait (which we happily agreed to since we wanted an authentic omakase without the exorbitant prices in Tokyo). The sushi chef was an elderly Japanese man in his 70s or early 80s who ran the place himself and declined at least 4 groups of tourists who came in to eat while we were seated (the max capacity of the place must be 2-4 I guess!).

Tokyo (May 30 - June 3, 2025) 
======

After a 4 hour train from Matsumoto, we found ourselves back in Tokyo where we checked into a new hotel in Shinjuku, a famous downtown neighborhood in Tokyo right near the world’s busiest railway station (handling over 3.5 million passengers daily!). Since this was our last stop before flying back to North America and we had bought an extra suitcase to fill up, we were determined to take advantage of the discounted and tax-free shopping Tokyo had to offer before flying home.

![Tokyo-End-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1TCanNiuToxCbb_q6fH0msBZb0-XSj2qt&sz=w1000)
_Mass of people crossing the street towards downtown Shinjuku_

Over the couple days we were in Tokyo, we repeatedly visited Yodobashi Camera, an **absolutely massive** electronics department store that was spread across multiple properties, each with 7 floors (despite its name, Yodobashi Camera sold everything from household goods to speakers to camera equipment to luxury watches). We probably spent about half of our remaining time in Tokyo visiting different downtown districts (i.e. Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Ginza) to go shopping (which is something I usually hate but was somehow more fun in Tokyo). If you’re visiting Tokyo and want to check out some fun stores, I’d highly recommend Yodobashi Camera, Bic Camera, MUJI, UNIQLO, and Itoya as places worth visiting (even just for window shopping).

Now onto the food! Since we were in Tokyo, I was particularly excited to visit a conveyor belt sushi restaurant; for the most part we’d avoided eating sushi too frequently while there since it was so cost-prohibitive but we were giant fans of the conveyor belt sushi restaurant we found in Shinjuku which was fantastic (and especially fantastic value). I’d be remiss if I didn’t also plug how amazing the 7-11s are in Japan. We had visited some pretty great 7-11s in other Asian countries (notably Taiwan and Thailand) but Japan’s 7-11s might take the cake as our favorite, and I’m (only sorta) embarrassed to admit that we ate most of our breakfasts at 7-11. The big winners from 7-11 were their fried chicken, cheese curry croquettes, fresh-made smoothie machines (!), and onigiri, all of which we consumed nearly every day.

We spent one afternoon metroing down to Shibuya station to walk through Yoyogi Park, a welcome breath of greenery after all the massive skyscrapers and department stores of downtown Tokyo (it also reminded us a bit of Golden Gate Park, our favorite part of San Francisco). Next to Yoyogi Park, we visited Meiji Shrine which, despite being in downtown Tokyo, is oddly serene, nestled in a vast forest of over 100,000 trees donated from all over Japan back when the shrine was constructed. To reach Meiji Shrine, you walk through the forest along a peaceful broad walkway passing through massive, towering wooden torii gates. Along the way you pass a wall of decorative sake barrels and burgundy wine barrels symbolizing the cultural exchange between Japan and the West, a hallmark of Emperor Meiji’s reign and legacy.

Since we enjoyed Yayoi Kusama‘s exhibit in Matsumoto so much, we decided to visit Ropponi district to spend an afternoon at the National Art Center Tokyo which is 100% worth visiting. We saw so many amazing pieces during our few hours there - especially impressive were the pieces using embroidery/fabric as a visual medium, it’s absolutely crazy the visual effects that these artists are able to accomplish in these unusual (to me) mediums.

Lastly, I need to mention one of my favorite things about Japan: the presence of jazz **everywhere**. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that >50% of the corner stores, coffee shops, department stores, etc were playing classic jazz over their speakers when we stopped by. Since there’s so much jazz in Japan, and especially Tokyo, we were determined to visit a jazz club before flying home. We found a well-reviewed and reasonably priced jazz club, Shinjuku Pit Inn, that had live jazz 7 nights per week to visit on our last night in Tokyo. The night we visited featured the Takako Yamada Trio (piano, double bass, percussion) who played a two hour set of experimental+classic jazz pieces in an intimate underground venue. We were surprised to see that about half of the other patrons were gray-haired Japanese men in business suits (mostly alone) and they were all **super** enthusiastic about the music. We spoke with Takako Yamada after the show to buy and have her sign one of her CDs, and learned that we even overlapped with her in Boston 15 years ago where she had studied at the Berkelee School of Music for her Master’s!

It’s crazy to think that over 6 months have passed since we left North America to travel, and our big trip through Asia is already over. It somehow feels like we only just left and yet simultaneously like it was a lifetime ago. We’ll be back in North America for a few months to visit family and roadtrip across Canada before starting our next big adventure: 3 months in Central/South America!
