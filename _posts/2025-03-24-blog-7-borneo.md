Wildlife spotting in Borneo!
======

![Travel-Map](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1yGKMEEQYolvI8z7y5BqTSPxWO_voLg-g&sz=w1000)

We spent an unforgettable 3 weeks in Sarawak and Sabah exploring winding rivers and ancient rainforests to see its legendary wildlife. This was one of our favorite stops of the entire trip so far and there was still so much more to see after 3 weeks there - I’m sure we’ll be back to explore the rest of the island someday!

Sarawak - Kuching (March 6-7 & 10-11, 2025) 
======

Following 2 weeks vacationing on the Thai islands, Sara and I were excited to jump on a plane and visit Borneo, an island famous for its exotic wildlife and indigenous tribal history. Today, the island of Borneo is divided into the Southern region (part of Indonesia) and the Northern region (composed of the two Malaysian provinces, Sarawak and Sabah, separated by the small independent nation of Brunei). Since we didn’t have time to visit the entire island, we instead planned for 3 weeks in Sarawak and Sabah.

We flew into Kuching (which, to our delight, means “cat” in Malay), the capital of Sarawak Province, and got a taxi to our hotel downtown; we picked a guesthouse that felt like a 1900s traditional Chinese mansion right on the waterfront and would spend our evenings strolling alongside the river at sunset, a habit we’d gotten into on our trip in any major riverside city. From across the river you can see the beautifully designed Sarawak Legislative Assembly building which is lit up each evening with massive LED lights as the backdrop for the nightly water fountain show.

On our first full day in Kuching, we visited the Borneo Cultures Museum which was a short 15min walk from the waterfront, and one of the best museums we’d visited so far on our trip. The Borneo Cultures Museum is the largest in Malaysia and is split into five floors covering Sarawak history, indigenous tribes and their environment, prehistory and archaeology, indigenous artifacts and craftsmanship, and a children’s gallery (which we skipped). Especially interesting to learn all about the famous Dayak headhunters of Borneo who would keep the heads of their tribal enemies in their homes as displays of social status and spiritual power. We got lucky on timing and found that they were currently running a special exhibit, “Pristine Oceans”, on the main floor in collaboration with National Geographic that showcased photography and stories of marine conservation. Sara and I joked that they put on this exhibit just for us given that marine conservation is something we talk and think a lot about, and that we had the entire exhibit to ourselves for an hour!

Given how culturally distinct Sarawak is from the rest of Malaysia (as well as the rest of Borneo), we went out of our way to find some traditional Sarawak cuisine while in Kuching. We tried Sarawak Laksa, a curry noodle soup dish that Anthony Bourdain called “the breakfast of the gods”, and I even found a “poutine a la Sarawak” which had laksa curry for gravy (not really a real poutine but tasty anyways). One morning for breakfast we visited one of Kuching’s most popular Chinese _Kolo Mee_ spots (egg noodles with char siu and fried onions) and another evening we went to an indigenous Sarawak restaurant where we tried fried jungle ferns and _Ayam Pansuh_ (chicken cooked in bamboo). Since we were in Borneo over Ramadan, Sara excitedly pointed out that we’d be able to find _kek lapis_, a traditional layer cake made only in Sarawak; sure enough, within a block of our hotel there were multiple places selling every variety of multicolored _kek lapis_. We opted for a green and white coconut one which was delicious but way, way too much food for us.

On one of our last days in Sarawak, we visited the Brooke Gallery at Fort Margherita just across the river from our hotel to learn more about [James Brooke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brooke), who ruled Sarawak from 1841 until his death in 1868 as the first governor (or White Rajah). Unlike many other European rulers of Southeast Asian colonies of the era, James Brooke was, by all accounts, a benevolent and well-loved ruler throughout his reign. For years prior to Brooke’s arrival, the indigenous population of Sarawak had been cheated by Chinese and Malaysian traders and terrorized by pirates that would raze whole tribal villages for profit. James Brooke’s first act was a military campaign of anti-piracy and anti-slavery in which he outlawed and hunted down the many pirates preying on Borneo. By virtually all historical accounts, a combination of his anti-piracy campaign, his insistence on equality among his European, Malay, and indigenous Dayak subjects, and his style of governance of non-interference with tribal matters, created a legacy of Brooke as a respected and well-loved leader of Sarawak.

Sarawak - Bako National Park (March 8-10, 2025) 
======

_Wild bearded pigs on the beach at Bako National Park_

Kuching is surrounded by a number of small national parks, the oldest of which is Bako, located about 40km north of Kuching. Though possible as a day trip, we decided to spend 2 nights in the park to maximize our chances of seeing wildlife by being onsite every morning for dawn hikes. We made a reservation through the national park service to stay in one of the park lodges for 2 nights, and set off on a 45min Grab ride to the Bako jetty followed by a 30min boat trip to the national park. The accommodations at the park lodge were pretty basic but decent enough; unfortunately there was an ongoing power outage the entire time we were there so our room had no electricity and thus no fan which made the stifling humid heat (32C/90% humidity) a bit of a challenge after being on our feet all day!

_National Park lodge where we stayed for 2 nights_

Bako’s biggest star is undoubtedly the Proboscis monkey, a long-tailed primate with a long, pendulous nose that is endemic to Borneo (hilariously, the name in Malay literally means “Dutch man”). We got lucky and spotted one immediately on our walk in from the beach sitting on the grass by our lodge, and then again on our first evening walk around the jungle boardwalks before dinner hanging out in a tree munching leaves. Definitely see why it’s considered the “world’s weirdest monkey”!

_Proboscis monkey (Nasalis larvatus)_

After dinner, we joined a group of about 20 other travelers for the night jungle walk and walked around the park headquarters for 1.5hrs with a handful of Malaysian guides with bright headlamps scouring the trees for nocturnal wildlife. We were first brought out to the beachside mangrove forest to see hundreds of fireflies that are attracted to the salt excreted from the mangrove leaves, an evolutionary adaptation that allows mangroves (unlike most tree species) to thrive in high-salinity environments. We had good luck with nighttime wildlife spotting, and ended up seeing a Bornean keeled green pit viper, a dog-toothed cat snake, flying lemur (endemic to Borneo), palm civet, sleeping proboscis monkey, banded gecko, huntsman spider, and extremely vocal brown tree frogs. Although there was little chance it would move since it was digesting a meal, the Bornean keeled green viper was a bit of a scary sight since its bite is extremely neurotoxic and is generally lethal to humans in 6-7 hours; our guide humorously told us that depending on the tide, most boats to the mainland can’t make it here in time for medical evac so one bite and you’re a goner!

The next day, we got up at dawn to go birding and try to see some early morning wildlife, spotting more Proboscis monkeys, lots of bearded pigs (some of my favorite animals in the national park), a better view of the nocturnal flying lemurs resting on a tree, a banded cuckoo, a crimson sunbird, and a handful of bold-striped tit-babblers.

After breakfast we decided to hike the Lintang Loop, a 3.5hr hike up 900ft through all 7 different ecosystems present in the park. As you ascend elevation along this hike, you pass from the hot+humid jungle up onto a sandy/rocky plateau devoid of any trees but with plenty of carnivorous pitcher plants lining the trail. We also saw **absolutely massive ant trails** with tens of thousands of ants and a pair of furtive but beautiful black-bellied malkohas right off the trail in the fruit trees.

One last notable species we saw was the silver leaf monkey. We spent the better part of an hour before dinner on our last night watching a group of ~15 of them eating leaves in low-hanging trees and playing on the beach. For some reason a couple of the juveniles kept crouching down by the small pools of seawater pooled on the beach; since I can’t imagine they were drinking the saltwater, my headcanon is that they were amused by their own reflections and kept coming back for a look.

Sabah - Kinabalu Park (March 12-16, 2025)
======

![12-Kinabalu](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1EIi6uBsX6Nx4yX4Qz1yRiC7E8yoCfcHh&sz=w1000)
_Mt Kinabalu in the early morning_

After five days in Sarawak, we took a 1.5hr flight to Sabah, the other Malaysian province in Borneo, flying into Kota Kinabalu (“KK”) in the late morning. We went straight from the airport to the local bus station north of the city, and rode a bus heading to Kundasang for 2 hours before jumping off at the Kinabalu Park Headquarters, and walking the 1.5km to our mountain lodge.

![13-Kinabalu](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1MUwECixYZQNFck0P-GcGn0FuaF9b8b8f&sz=w1000)
_View from our balcony at Ayana Lodge_

The main reason we visited Kinabalu Park was because it’s one of Borneo’s top birding hotspots and contains species that aren’t found anywhere else on the island due to the higher elevation. We’d originally also wanted to trek up to Mt Kinabalu’s summit but, after some research, realized it was too pricey for our budget (the 2D/1N trek starts at a minimum of $500 USD!). Instead we spent the next two mornings getting up at dawn, walking the 1.5km to the park headquarters, and birding for 3-4 hours along the main road up from the park headquarters and down along the river trail. The only people on the road at that hour were birders (since the climbers didn’t start until 8am) and we had lots of delightful interactions trading tips and sightings with other (mostly older German, Dutch, and British) birders.

_Selfie at Kinabalu Park HQ before a morning of birding_

The main target species at Kinabalu Park are the “Whitehead Trio” (Whitehead Trogon, Whitehead Broadbill, and Whitehead Spiderhunter) that can’t be found anywhere else in the world. Our first morning, we walked up the main road and down a river trail (~5mi total) seeing 23 species of which 13 were new to us including the Whitehead Trogon. We caught sight of a male and female Whitehead trogon (our first trogon of any kind) about 3/4 the way up the main road posing on a vine, and were able to share the sighting with a youngish German guy who was out birding with his newborn in a baby bjorn on his back (first time seeing that too!). Later on in the day we saw 3 more male Whitehead Trogons but neither of the remaining two of the Whitehead Trio. Some of the other notable species we saw included an unbelievably large mountain imperial pigeon (we first thought it was a hawk), a maroon woodpecker, a Bornean treepie, multiple yellow-breasted warblers, a blue-and-white flycatcher, two indigo flycatchers, and a bornean forktail (see photos of some of these birds [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-03-23-portfolio-7-borneo)). Famished, we walked back along the road to our mountain lodge and stopped at a roadside restaurant where Sara and I both had Chinese tea and Bak Kut Teh (which translates from the Hokkien dialect to “meat bone tea”) which we’d never tried but ended up being one of the most interesting and delicious bone broths we’d had on our trip. We spent the rest of our afternoon and evening on our balcony, looking out over the mountain valley, reading and going over our bird photos and checklists.

The next morning we set off again for Kinabalu Park a few minutes before dawn and spent another 3-4 hours birding before breakfast up and down the main road from park headquarters searching primarily for the Whitehead Broadbill and the Whitehead Spiderhunter. About halfway through our morning, out of nowhere we saw a flash of emerald in the forest and caught a lucky 60 second window with good visibility of the Whitehead Broadbill that allowed for some good shots. This broadbill has gotta be one of my favorite sightings and one of the weirdest birds we’ve seen over the past four months so we were super happy to get a glimpse of it (especially since none of the other birders we ran into while there had seen one).

After this last morning of birding at Kinabalu Park, we got a driver to take us to Poring Hot Springs, a weekend destination for locals on the other side of Mt. Kinabalu that we wanted to visit since we heard it had good hiking, birding, and butterflies (though I think more people probably visit for the hot springs!). After checking into our new lodge 10min from Poring Hot Springs, we decided to take it easy since we’d gotten up before dawn, and I started reading Alfred Russell Wallace’s book _The Malay Archipelago_. This book, published in 1869, covers Alfred Russell Wallace’s 8 years of scientific exploration through Southeast Asia from 1854-1862 collecting entomology and ornithology specimens. Although not nearly as much of a household name as he should be, Alfred Russell Wallace came up with the theory of evolution contemporaneously with Charles Darwin, based on his observations traveling through Southeast Asia as a naturalist. It’s fascinating to read his travel notes and wildlife observations in some of the same spots that Sara and I have been traveling to and reflect on the changes over the past 150 years. One of the most enduring insights from his travels (beyond his contributions to the modern theory of natural selection) is that of the [Wallace Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Line) which describes a geographic boundary in Southeast Asia that separates ancestral Asiatic species from ancestral Australian species, and allowed him to draw conclusions about the geological history of the region. Reading this, we’re especially excited to be visiting Sulawesi and Raja Ampat in Indonesia after Borneo since they’re right over this transitional zone and thus home to scores of new mammals and birds that we haven’t seen so far while traveling (which has been exclusively to the west of the Wallace Line).

One of the main attractions around the Poring Hot Springs are the flowering [Rafflesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafflesia) (also known as “stinking corpse lilies”), the largest flowering plant in the world. They bloom unpredictably and only last for 5 days so there are makeshift signs on the road all around the hot springs advertising if a local home has one blooming which you can stop by to see for a dollar or two. The property neighboring our lodge happened to have one on its second day of bloom so we walked over as soon as we arrived to have a look and get a photo.

The Poring Hot Springs have an attached butterfly farm with a butterfly enclosure where we spent an hour or so slowly walking around and learning about endemic butterfly species in Borneo (I like to think Wallace would be proud of how we’re spending our time). Though we didn’t go into the hot springs themselves (they were pricey and it was pretty hot+humid already), we did spend a good while wandering around the grounds photographing the butterflies, birds, and plants there. The next day we got up at dawn to hike up the 2000+ ft trail to Kipungit Waterfall which starts right near the hot springs. It was a fairly long, strenuous hike up through the hot and humid jungle to the almost chilly waterfall at the top but worth it for the final views. The only other hikers were a couple of groups of local high school/college students (who seemed much less winded than us) who happily took a few shots of us before we made our way back down and napped for the afternoon.

Sabah - Sepilok (March 16-17, 2025)
======

After two nights near Poring Hot Springs, the owner of our lodge and his son drove us to nearby Ranau where we caught a bus to Sepilok; we were super grateful to have the help of his English-speaking son since booking the bus online was basically impossible (this was actually a KK-to-Sandakan bus whose driver agreed to stop and pick us up along the route after our lodge gave him a call). Originally Sepilok wasn’t on our list but Sara and I both needed a break from activity with good wifi to take care of our taxes so we booked two nights at the Sepilok Jungle Lodge and were determined to not overextend ourselves with activity so we could spend some time filing our taxes (real life doesn’t stop when you’re traveling I guess).

_Sepilok Jungle Resort where we stayed for two nights_

We still got up around dawn every morning to walk around the Sepilok Jungle Resort property which was a sprawling, verdant area with enough good birdlife that it had [its own eBird hotspot](https://ebird.org/hotspot/L4353562) with 236 reported species. One evening on our walk to the resort restaurant we spotted a Stork-billed Kingfisher repeatedly smashing a fish it had caught onto a tree branch to eventually gobble it down - very fun sighting that, unlike many of our birding adventures, required virtually no work on our part!

_Stork-billed Kingfisher with its dinner right outside of the resort restaurant where we ate ours_

Our one planned activity while in Sepilok was to visit the [Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre](https://www.orangutan-appeal.org.uk/about-us/sepilok-orangutan-rehabilitation-centre) which is one of the main reasons tourists come to the region. Its primary mission is to rescue and rehabilitate these endangered primates, and they’re open every morning and afternoon for visitors to come and see orangutan feedings. On our visit, we sat out in the rain and spent 30min watching an orangutan mother and her baby eating massive amounts of fruits and vegetables that were brought to them by one of the staff there. The baby orangutan was particularly fun to watch as it was incessantly active, climbing all around the feeding platform in a variety of different acrobatic positions.

Sabah - Kinabatangan River (March 18-20, 2025)
======

We next booked two nights at a homestay in Sukau on the Kinabatangan River, arguably the best spot in all of Sabah to see Bornean wildlife and the [“Borneo Big 5”](https://www.borneoecotours.com/blog/borneo-big-5/): the Pygmy Elephant, the Proboscis Monkey, the Orangutan, the Rhinoceros Hornbill, and the Estuarine Crocodile.

_View of the Kinabatangan River from the balcony of our homestay_

Our homestay arranged a driver to pick us up in Sepilok and drive us down the 3 hours to Sukau through the heavy rain. When we arrived near Sukau, our driver said that his cousin would now drive us somewhere and so our drivers quickly changed and we zoomed away down a random dirt road where ~15 tourists and guides were gathered in their ponchos and pouring rain (we were pretty confused the whole time). We arrive just in time to see a baby Pygmy Elephant in the distance ambling off into the jungle and then learned that the cousin who took over driving was actually our homestay host and guide for the next two days! Since these sightings are rare and can happen at any time of day, you have to drop everything when the call arrives, quickly jump in a car and run out to where the elephants were last seen (we got another similar call the next day but arrived a few minutes to late to catch another sighting).

![24-Kinabatangan](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1YZ1mcJUJr-u1ip88j_eS7Qca9dvL1WIJ&sz=w1000)
_Afternoon boat tour along the Kinabatangan River_

Since we were the only guests at the homestay that first night we got a private boat tour that afternoon along the Kinabatangan River with our host Rame, and actually caught a lucky break in the rain and had the most productive sightings of our time there (see [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-03-23-portfolio-7-borneo) for photos of the hornbills and other birds on the Kinabatangan River). To give some sense of the diversity and frequency of wildlife there, I took some notes on when we observed the following species (not even a complete list!):
<br/> _4:10 - Pig-tailed Macaque_
<br/> _4:21 - Crested Serpent-Eagle_
<br/> _4:25 - Long-tailed Macaque_
<br/> _4:28 - Wrinkled Hornbill_
<br/> _4:32 - Oriental Pied-Hornbill_
<br/> _4:32 - Black Hornbill_
<br/> _4:37 - Bushy-crested Hornbill_
<br/> _4:45 - Lesser Fish-Eagle_
<br/> _4:53 - Buffy Fish-Owl_
<br/> _4:56 - Black-and-red Broadbill_
<br/> _5:13 - Orangutan_
<br/> _5:25 - Lesser Adjutant_
<br/> _5:52 - Proboscis Monkey_

_Juvenile orangutan spotted on an estuary of the Kinabatangan River_

The most exciting sighting of the first boat tour was undoubtedly the pair of wild orangutans (an older female and a juvenile) we spotted down an estuary of the Kinabatangan River; Rame was an amazing guide and I have no idea how he spotted them. Since all the guides know each other and spread the word of exciting sightings, we were soon joined by 3-4 other boats to catch a glimpse of the orangutans but had a few minutes there by ourselves first. Orangutan mothers will raise their children for 7-10 years before they become fully independent, and the mothers will make a new nest out of leaves and palm fronds in this way every evening in less than 10 minutes since they forage over a wide range for food.

One of the benefits of staying at a homestay is that our boat tours had max 6 people compared to 25 at the large package resorts. The other big benefit was the amazing food that Rame’s wife Mei made for us at each meal during our stay there. We’d found the food in Borneo overall to be a bit of a letdown but Mei’s cooking was some of our favorite food so far and definitely our favorite during our time in Borneo. Since you stay in a room in their home, it was also fun to interact a bit with their kids, especially their youngest son whose favorite word seemed to be “Bye-Bye” which he’d run up to us, wave and utter every few minutes as we would hang out on the porch reading.

The next day we were joined by 3 French girls in their late 20s (two of them were one their honeymoon and the third was actually the twin sister of one of the girls and was crashing the Borneo portion of their honeymoon!) and a Singaporean woman in her late 30s so we no longer had the place to ourselves. Sadly they brought the bad weather back with them and our brief window of clear skies disappeared for the rest of our time there. Nevertheless we still went out 3x per day for 2hr boat cruises along the Kinabatangan River in the pouring rain to see what wildlife we could spot.

_Sara braving the rain in her 75 cent poncho to see more wildlife_

Although we didn’t see much new on the morning or afternoon boat tour, our evening cruise (though very cold and rainy) got us some fun sightings of nocturnal wildlife like a palm civet, a bronzed snake, flying foxes, multiple baby estuarine crocodiles as well as some sleeping birds (blue-eared kingfishers, stork-billed kingfishers, and black-and-red broadbills) and sleeping proboscosis monkeys. Rame even caught one of the baby crocodiles by hand and brought it into the boat so we could have a closer look! Although this baby was only about a foot long, adult estuarine crocodiles are the largest and heaviest of all reptiles and can grow to 23 feet!

_Baby estuarine crocodiles that Rame grabbed out of the river by hand!_

On our last morning before leaving the Kinabatangan River, Sara and I went off by ourselves to walk along the roads of Sukau a bit past dawn instead of paying for an additional boat cruise and were lucky enough to see a pair of Rhinoceros Hornbills, completing our sightings of the Borneo Big 5! As we’d heard from multiple other travelers before coming here, the Kinabatangan River is definitely one of the best places in Borneo to witness endemic Bornean wildlife. However, this high concentrated biodiversity is tragically due to the destruction of the surrounding rainforest over the past few decades which has increasingly narrowed their habitable range down to the riverbanks. The rise in popularity and revenue brought in by ecotourism is having a positive impact in preserving their remaining habitat but sadly much of the irreversible damage has already been done. Happy note to end on, I know.

Sabah - Danum Valley (March 20-23, 2025)
======

![30-Danum](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1-n0DeTSTtqUi_9PnivxMaJd63yoFLntI&sz=w1000)
_Danum Valley Field Center Headquarters_

For our final stop in Borneo, we spent 3D/2N visiting Danum Valley, an ancient rainforest in Sabah that has never known human settlement and has remarkable biodiversity that’s essentially been untouched by human development. The only options for accommodations were at a fancy rainforest lodge, which was out of our budget, or the Danum Valley Field Center, which is where the PhD students and field biologists conduct their research (obviously this is where we went). Since you’re not allowed to hike in the jungle without a guide at Danum Valley, we were paired with a park ranger and a few other travelers for our jungle treks.

_Difficult to capture just how dense the vegetation was in Danum Valley_

While there, we got up at dawn to hike 4 hours first thing in the morning, then 2 hours after lunch and then again 2 hours after dinner to see nocturnal animals. While our actually mileage wasn’t particularly impressive on any of these hikes, it was surprising just how exhausting these jungle treks were. The combination of heat, humidity, difficult technical terrain, intermittent rain, and, worst of all, the inescapable [jungle leeches](https://www.rainforestjournal.com/leeches/) left us exhausted at the end of every hike. Despite this, the experience overall was pretty great and one of our most memorable rainforest trips.

_Red leaf monkey, an endemic of Borneo, spotted in Danum Valley_

By far our most productive trek was the dawn walk on our second day where we saw a male red leaf monkey, a young female gibbon with her baby high up in the treetops, and a juvenile Great Argus that walked along the trail towards the end of our hike. The Great Argus is arguably the bird Sara has most wanted to see on this trip and we’d already given up hope of seeing it since it’s so rare and shy. I managed to snap a photo of it (below) but unfortunately the low morning light and flighty nature of the Great Argus didn’t make for a great shot. The male Great Argus has one of the most [impressive mating displays](https://thephotosociety.org/how-we-filmed-the-great-argus-pheasant/) of any bird and couldn’t believe our luck that we caught sight of even a juvenile in the wild.

_Sara and I spotted a juvenile Great Argus pheasant_

Gibbons are more often heard than seen in the rainforest, and make themselves known from great distances away with their haunting calls starting before dawn. We were lucky to be paired with a great guide who spent a while tracking their calls and managed to find a female swinging through the treetops with her baby. Our guide informed us that gibbons are the fastest moving of any primate, using their disproportionately long arms to gracefully swing through the treetops with little apparent effort.

Besides the unforgettable sighting of the Great Argus, we didn’t have much luck seeing many of the amazing birds that are known to live in Danum Valley though we heard plenty, reminding me just why I hate jungle birding. Over our time there, we heard the Indian Cuckoo, the Bornean Bristleback (often called “the holy grail of Borneo birds”), the Blue-banded Pitta, the Black-crowned Pitta, and the Blue-headed Pitta. Sadly we once again failed to actually see or photograph any of these beautiful birds so photographing a Pitta will have to remain a goal of mine on this trip.

_Polyrhachis ypsilon, one of the coolest ants I’ve seen so far_

We did however have tons of success finding interesting bugs, especially during the night walks (reminding me of the British birder we befriended in Fraser’s Hill, Malaysia who wisely told us he was also a bug photographer so he was never disappointed when he invariably failed to see birds in the jungle). Some of these were extremely interesting, like Polyrhachis ypsilon, a beautiful golden ant with huge curved hooks on its back (above), while others like the giant long-legged centipede or the giant huntsman spider (below) were just plain dangerous and horrifying.

Still though, despite the constant rain, the jungle leeches and terrifyingly large insects, Danum Valley was unforgettable and absolutely worth the visit.
