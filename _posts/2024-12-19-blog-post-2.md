4 weeks in Cambodia
======

Our first stop on our extended Southeast Asia trip was Cambodia since it holds a special place in Sara’s heart (Sara and her family actually lived in Cambodia for 3 years from 1996-1999!), and we had just visited back in February so were familiar with the country/currency/language. We intentionally did minimal planning so we could be spontaneous with our travel decisions and ended up spending close to a month in Cambodia.

_Streetview of Phnom Penh and its ubiquitous tuktuks_

We flew into Phnom Penh and spent a couple days exploring the capital of Cambodia. Since we’d just visited 6 months ago, we were able to skip some of the touristy must-sees (i.e. Royal Palace, National Museum, Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, …), and focus on recovering from jet lag and resetting our circadian rhythms after 36hrs of traveling. This time we picked a hotel in Boeung Kong Kong (BKK), a neighborhood right next to Russian Market which is one of our favorite places to wander around and get street food in Phnom Penh.

For a city of ~2.5 million people, Phnom Penh always feels surprisingly walkable and _tuktuks_ will take you anywhere in the city you can’t walk to for about $1 USD. For the most part, we spent our few days here wandering around the riverfront, getting **amazing** Cambodian iced coffees, and seeking out good rooftop restaurants/bars to enjoy the sunset over the Mekong River.
