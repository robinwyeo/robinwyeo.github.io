4 weeks in Cambodia
======

Our first stop on our extended Southeast Asia trip was Cambodia since it holds a special place in Sara’s heart (Sara and her family actually lived in Cambodia for 3 years from 1996-1999!), and we had just visited back in February so were familiar with the country/currency/language. We intentionally did minimal planning so we could be spontaneous with our travel decisions and ended up spending close to a month in Cambodia.

Phnom Penh (Nov 23-27, 2024)
======

_Streetview of Phnom Penh and its ubiquitous tuktuks_

We flew into Phnom Penh and spent a couple days exploring the capital of Cambodia. Since we’d just visited 6 months ago, we were able to skip some of the touristy must-sees (i.e. Royal Palace, National Museum, Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, …), and focus on recovering from jet lag and resetting our circadian rhythms after 36hrs of traveling. This time we picked a hotel in Boeung Kong Kong (BKK), a neighborhood right next to Russian Market which is one of our favorite places to wander around and get street food in Phnom Penh.

For a city of ~2.5 million people, Phnom Penh always feels surprisingly walkable and _tuktuks_ will take you anywhere in the city you can’t walk to for about $1 USD. For the most part, we spent our few days here wandering around the riverfront, getting **amazing** Cambodian iced coffees, and seeking out good rooftop restaurants/bars to enjoy the sunset over the Mekong River.

Battambang (Nov 27-28, 2024)
======

Instead of the regular bus lines, we decided to take the train from Phnom Penh to Battambang which I highly recommend. The journey is slow and scenic (taking about 8 hours) and mostly ridden by locals, offering a great way to see the Cambodian countryside as we made our way westward across the country to Battambang.

_View of the Sangker River from town_

Despite being passed over by most travelers to Cambodia, Battambang was one of our favorite short stops. Known for its colonial architecture, vibrant arts scene, and beautiful countryside, I’d recommend visiting for its sunset riverside strolls alone.

_Cooking class at Coconut Lyly’s Restaurant_

On the morning of our second day there, we took a cooking class at Coconut Lyly where the owner/chef first took us to the local market to pick up ingredients, and then taught us how to make chicken amok (fish amok is Cambodia’s most famous dish), vegetable spring rolls, and green mango salad.

_Phare circus show_

We spent the evening seeing a show at [Phare Circus](www.pharecircus.org), a circus and social enterprise. Phare was started in 1994 by 9 young men coming home from a refugee camp after the Khmer Rouge regime who, believing in the power of art therapy, chose to use circus and theater to showcase uniquely Cambodian stories. Proceeds from the circus shows go on to support over 1200 Cambodian students studying theater, arts, music, and circus, as well as extensive outreach programs in the community. We enjoyed this show and learning about the association so much that we saw another of their shows in Siem Reap graduates from the Phare circus school in Battambang that want to become professionals go on to develop their careers in circus arts.

Tonle Sap (Nov 29-30, 2024)
======

_Boat trip up the Sangker River towards the floating villages of Tonle Sap_

When planning our trip, we were excited to visit one of the floating villages on Cambodia’s Great lake (Tonle Sap) and experience the unique way of life of this section of Cambodia but we’re unsure how to do it in a more immersive, authentic way. After some research we came across an opportunity to do a homestay with Hoksan and his family who run the non-profit organization [Prek Toal Moving Ahead](https://prektoal-movingahead.org/) to support the local community.

![6-Tonle-Sap](/images/Blog-2/6-Tonle-Sap.jpeg)
_Paddling around the floating villages with Hoksan’s aunt_

After arriving few hours of boating up the Sangker River, we arrived at Hoksan’s village where every house, building, and school floats on Tonle Sap, a necessity given that the water level changes ~30 feet between the annual wet and dry season! Hoksan and his aunt showed us around the village by paddle boat: we visited the local Wat to see the monks, stopped by the middle school to meet a grade 3 class (who were very entertained to pepper us with questions), and check out a freshwater crocodile farm before heading out to see sunset over the lake.

Hoksan is also an avid bird guide (one of the reasons we were so excited to homestay with him and his family) so on our second day there we got up 2 hours before dawn to boat to the Prek Toal Bird Sanctuary. We spent the morning in a treehouse where a Cambodian ranger lives year-round to monitor the population levels of the local bird populations and prevent poaching. Saw a staggering amount of painted storks, spot-billed pelicans, and even the greater and lesser adjutants which I think are truly the ugliest/creepiest birds we’ve sighted so far [(eBird checklist)](https://ebird.org/checklist/S204027758). I was also able to capture a shot of the pied kingfisher to send to Hoksan to hang up in his home since it’s his favorite bird and he lost his camera to the water birding last year.
