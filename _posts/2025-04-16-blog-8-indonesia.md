Indonesia is just too big
======

In the words of Douglas Adams, Indonesia _“is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mind-boggingly big it is.”_ (Okay, Douglas Adams was talking about space when he wrote this but I think he’d agree the principle also applies to Indonesia.) So, instead of spending a small number of days on each of Indonesia’s big islands, we decided to just pick two small regions and give ourselves enough time to fully experience them. After some thought, we settled on spending a week in the tiny northeastern tip of Sulawesi and two weeks in the small collection of islands in West Papua known as Raja Ampat.

Bunaken Island, North Sulawesi (March 24-27, 2025) 
======

We flew into Manado on the island of Sulawesi (Indonesia) from Kota Kinabalu (Borneo) early in the morning on March 24<sup>th</sup> and were immediately accosted outside the airport by about a dozen taxi drivers. Unlike a number of other Southeast Asian airports we’d flown into, these drivers were all pretty friendly and had reasonable prices so we hired one to take us into town so we could get a local SIM card and withdraw enough Indonesian Rupiah to tide us over for our two days on Bunaken Island which doesn’t have any ATMs. It turned out that our timing in visiting was pretty fortuitous as the last few days had been torrential in Manado and had even caused flooding, but that the rain had finally let up just in time for our visit. Immediate errands complete, we arrived at the local ferry terminal just in time to catch the daily boat out to Bunaken Island (first time it was running in 3 days due to the bead weather!).

_The local ferry delivers daily supplies to Bunaken Island as well as passengers (we even saw 3 live ducks tied into a single canvas bag with their heads poking out, presumably someone’s dinner on the island)_

We decided to stay at a homestay on Bunaken since it was right across the street from a reputable dive shop we’d researched (Blue Shark Diving) and was reviewed to have amazing food. For the next two days we ate the homestay owner’s wife’s incredible cooking, usually fresh caught fish served with the obligatory and ubiquitous [sambal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambal) - after the pretty bland food in Borneo, the great food was one of the highlights of our time on Bunaken.

_Over our 3 weeks in Indonesia, we probably averaged >2 fish meals per day_

The main reason we decided to visit Bunaken Island first was a combination of its proximity to Manado and the fact that it’s one of the top dive spots in Sulawesi. Over the next two days, we went out for 4 dives with Blue Shark Diving to re-acclimate ourselves with drift diving before our trip to Raja Ampat which has notoriously strong currents. Most of our Bunaken dives were along vertical coral walls and it wasn’t uncommon to see 20+ huge green sea turtles (some almost as large as me). We also got our first glimpse of my favorite nudibranch species, [_Chromodoris annae_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromodoris_annae), also known as “Anna’s magnificent sea slug”.

Afternoons and evenings on Bunaken were mostly spent relaxing/reading and going on sunset walks around the island. We usually ran into groups of friendly local children who were eager to practice their English and exchange high-fives and fist bumps (while this was a daily occasion back in Cambodia it had been a while since we had so many fun interactions with local kids). The only other guest at our homestay was an older German guy called Didi, an extremely well-traveled and accomplished diver, who we ate all of our meals with and chatted about our travels.  Since the three of us were all planning on heading to Tangkoko National Park after Bunaken, we decided to coordinate our travels the next day so we could split the taxi fare and save some money.

Tangkoko National Park, North Sulawesi (March 27-30, 2025) 
======

_Posing in front of Alfred Russell Wallace’s statue in Tangkoko NP_

After a short stint on Bunaken Island, we crossed back over to mainland Manado with Didi and found a taxi driver willing to take us the 2hrs to Tangkoko - he also sang Beatles karaoke for most of the drive there (surprisingly well I should add). The main draw of Tangkoko National Park is its high concentration of endemic wildlife that are relatively easy to find there. Alfred Russell Wallace (quickly becoming one of my and Sara’s favorite naturalists as we were both making our way through his book _The Malay Archipelago_), called Sulawesi “perhaps the most remarkable and interesting island in the whole archipelago, or even on the globe” due largely to its fascinating and perplexing wildlife. Sulawesi sits right on what is now known as the Wallace Line, separating ancestral Asian and Australasian species, and it was here in Sulawesi that Wallace made key observations that eventually led to his theory concerning this dividing line. There’s even a statue of Alred Russell Wallace near the entrance to Tangkoko National Park!

_The local catch of the day!_

Since we arrived too late to do a morning wildlife walk on our first day, we found a restaurant right on the beach and had lunch with Didi where we got to see a fisherman and his young kids hauling in **giant** marlin sailfish up the beach to sell to the restaurants. The beach restaurant was decorated with Christmas displays and wooden loons that I swear could have been bought in Bracebridge, Ontario (I learned in talking with the owner that they were given to them by a Canadian friend of the family who visited for over 30 years so my theory might even be correct!).

_Didi, Et, Sara, and me in Tangkoko NP_

Since we’d been enjoying Didi’s company, we arranged to do the next day’s morning and evening wildlife walks with him and split the cost of the guide. We got up at 5am and went out for a 4hr (10km) trek in Tangkoko NP, and ended up seeing all of the main endemic target species there: a troop of ~60 black macaques strolling through the forest, 3 bear cuscus, a green-backed kingfisher, and, after an hour of trekking off-trail, a knobbed hornbill high up in the treetops. For part of our walk, we were alongside a British couple and their two young kids resulting in one of my favorite declarations from their 8 year-old daughter: “I’m not lazy! I got up at 5am today!” (a statement that Sara and I would repeat to each other throughout the rest of our time in Sulawesi whenever we got up before dawn).

After an afternoon nap at our guesthouse down the road, we rejoined Didi and our guide Et for the evening walk in Tangkoko NP to see the black tarantula and spectral dusky tarsiers (one of the weirdest creatures I’ve seen so far).

While Didi had to make the trip back to Manado to return to Germany the next morning, we decided to stay an extra day in Tangkoko so we could go out the next morning with a birdwatching guide (Ono) to hopefully see more of Sulawesi’s endemic birdlife (Sulawesi has an inordinately large number of endemic species compared to most birding spots we’d visited). Our next day of birding started a bit before dawn at 5:30am and went until 7pm so we could spot the nocturnal owls that emerge after dusk (click [here](https://robinwyeo.github.io/portfolio/2025-04-03-portfolio-8-sulawesi) to see my photos of Sulawesi birds - including the Sulawesi Lilac Kingfisher, Speckled Boobook, and Sulawesi Scops-Owl that we saw on this trip with Ono).

Tomohon, North Sulawesi (March 30-April 2, 2025) 
======

After two days in a row getting up before dawn, we slept in a bit and got transport to Tomohon, a highland town in North Sulawesi nestled between two volcanoes, Mt Lokon and Mt Mahawu. Our main goals in visiting Tomohon were to trek up to one of the volcanic ridges and to see Sulawesi’s highland birds (almost completely different than those in Tangkoko due to the difference in elevation). After two days walking through the hot forest in Tangkoko, we also desperately needed to do laundry (and Sara had caught a cold) so we took the opportunity to rest a bit, and booked a bungalow right outside of town where we could relax for a day or two (turns out it rained anyways so good timing on our part!).

![14-Tomohon](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1McxGRGCCd2eACulXVGN826fXjcD37wo4&sz=w1000)
_Our bungalow in Tomohon_

We next hiked up to the crater of Mt Lokon, an active volcano with a half-dozen large fuming vents pouring out sulfurous gas. We met a group of locals (as best we could tell they were some sort of hiking club) at the top who were super excited to take pictures with us before we started our trek down; upon learning that I was Canadian, they also wanted to record videos of me speaking French encouraging their children to study hard so they could one day visit France (I guess France is a sexier destination for study than Canada…).

_Selfie at the crater of Mt Lokon_

Our guide Et from Tangkoko had given us the contact information of Adam, a friend of his who was a local birding guide in Tomohon, so the next day we set out at 5am with Adam to see Sulawesi’s highland birds. The main reasons birders come to Tomohon is to see the rare endemic Sulawesi Pitta and to see the half-dozen or so endemic flycatchers that you can only really see here at 1000+ meters. Lucky for us, Adam was a fantastic birding guide and we quickly saw all of our target flycatchers off the road up Mt Mahawu (another place that Wallace visited and wrote fondly of).

_Morning birding with Sara and our guide Adam_

However, our real target bird in Tomohon was the Sulawesi Pitta. If you’ve read some of my other travel posts, you might’ve read how we’ve tried and failed to see at least 4 different pitta species throughout our time in Southeast Asia (mainly Thailand and Borneo though we were also at birding spots with known pittas in Malaysia). The difficulty with pittas (or “jewelthrushes” as Wallace refers to them) is that they’re incredibly shy ground birds that live deep in the underbrush and don’t always respond to playback. Lucky for us, Adam pulled through and after 40 minutes in the jungle with no sign of it, Sara and I finally got our first good luck at one of Wallace’s “jewelthrushes”.

_Sulawesi Pitta_

Having finally seen the pitta, I could have gone home happy but Adam was determined to also find us the scaly-breasted kingfisher, another rare and endemic species to Sulawesi. This actually proved quite a bit harder than the pitta and took us about 2 hours of clomping off-trail through the jungle in the rain before we got a good sight of a perched male. During these two hours, we got pretty soaked and were attacked by tiny ants that even managed to stain my socks with blood from their constant bites. That, along with the difficult terrain, constant mosquitoes, and the fact that about 50% of the jungle plants had razor edges to them, left us feeling like the jungle was out to get us and we were happy to call it a day around 3pm. Adam offered to drive us all the way back to Manado and recommended a great hotel where we spent the night after buying some supplies we needed for our next stop: Raja Ampat in West Papua.

_Raja Ampat Travel Map_

Raja Ampat, an archipelago off the northwest tip of the great island of Papua, consists of a stunning chain of beach and jungle-covered islands and was one of the stops on our trip we were most excited about. It’s also a diver’s paradise. We’d talked to a bunch of divers in both Thailand and Sulawesi who all were quick to say that Raja Ampat was hands down the best diving they’d ever done. In fact, recent studies suggest that Raja Ampat may be the most biodiverse marine ecosystem on the planet<sup>[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-020-02020-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</sup>. The coral systems in Raja Ampat are so biodiverse that marine biologists believe it to be a biological hot spot restocking reefs throughout the South Pacific and Indian Oceans<sup>[2](https://academic.oup.com/fisheries/article-abstract/42/9/462/7834006?redirectedFrom=fulltext&utm_source=chatgpt.com)</sup>.

_Wayag, Raja Ampat, from a limestone karst viewpoint_

Until recently, Raja Ampat was relatively unknown and really only visited by hard-core divers on liveaboards; and although its popularity is definitely increasing in recent years, it’s still relatively protected from hoards of tourists by just how remote it is. The only way to get there is to fly all the way to Sorong, a city in West Papua, then take a series of ferries and chartered speedboats to the island where you’re staying to dive (also very few people in Raja Ampat speak ANY English and all goods/supplies, including all freshwater, have to be shipped in from the mainland). There are three main ways to visit Raja Ampat: expensive dive resorts, liveaboards, and, more recently, local homestays. We were extremely fortunate that one of our friends from the States, Alexander Stubbs, had been coming to Raja Ampat for the last fifteen years as part to his grad school research studying herpetology and was eager to help us plan the logistics of our trip; he even urged us to use his boat while we were there (yes, he somehow owns a boat that lives in Raja Ampat). He reached out to a dive guide (Pak Guru) and boat captain (Yance) that he was good friends with and we hired them for the next two weeks so we’d have the freedom to bounce around different homestays across Raja Ampat using his boat (as long as we could afford the fuel!). The amazing time we had in Raja Ampat was all due to Stubbs, so thank you!

_Pak Guru, Yance, Sara, and me on Stubbs’ boat Ingkri (you can see how much space 400L of fuel takes up in the drums in the back!)_

From Sulawesi, we got up at 4am after very little sleep and flew into Sorong to meet our dive guide, Pak Guru, who spoke “nominal” English according to Stubbs but should be enough for us to communicate and get around Raja Ampat. We first went to stock up on some snacks+supplies for the next two weeks since there aren’t any real stores once you set out from Sorong. We traveled from Sorong to Wasai, the main port on the large Raja island of Waigeo, by local ferry where we met Yance, the boat captain we’d hired to drive Stubbs’ boat “Ingkri” (“Spanish Mackerel” in Indonesian), and headed off to our homestay on Kri Island after buying and hauling 400L of fuel onboard.

_Pak Guru’s dive briefing on “Cape Kri”, his favorite dive site in Raja Ampat_

We stayed our first night on Kri Island and first thing in the morning did a “gear check” dive off the Yenkoranu home reef to make sure that all our equipment fit and worked well since we’d be using it for the rest of our trip. After a 1hr surface interval, we did a second dive at “Cape Kri”, Pak Guru’s favorite dive site in all of Raja Ampat (he’s done 350+ dives there!), where we were introduced to the notorious strong currents in Raja Ampat that we’d heard so much about. Thankfully we knew this coming in which is the main reason we’d wanted to do our Advanced PADI training in Thailand earlier this year and why we did 2 days of drift diving last week in Bunaken. True to everything we’d read about it, the diving in Raja Ampat did not disappoint: our first day of diving had crystal clear visibility and an unreal amount of biodiversity: some highlights were an eagle ray, green sea turtles, giant schools of banded barracudas, batfish, and yellowjacks.

![Kri-3](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=15RLAPLL9uiF0kV4NgAEeqdBr1VtP6_UT&sz=w1000)
_Spotted cuscus_

We spent the next two days on Gam Island which we wanted to visit since it had good bird reports and, critically, had a number of spots to see the red bird-of-paradise. We rose at 4am the next morning and boated down the island to another homestay where a young guy led us on an hour long walk into the jungle to try and spot the red birds-of-paradise (note: impressively, our guide did this whole jungle walk barefoot while Sara and I wore our hiking shoes). We got to the bird-of-paradise spot 30min before sunrise and were greeted by a mounting cacophony of bird and animal calls. Sadly, despite waiting there for about 90min the birds never showed themselves so we walked back to the beach disappointed (though we got sightings of a knobbed hornbill and two new species of cuscus, which are weird arboreal marsupials, on the walk back).

![Kri-4](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1nBk0i-jBx9HQcff0HhyQ8ko5RgraHnWQ&sz=w1000)
_Our homestay on Gam Island_

We spent the rest of our time on Gam Island split between early morning/late afternoon boat tours through the mangroves to look for birds, scuba diving, and hammock napping to recover from the former two activities (throughout our entire time in Indonesia, we got up before 5am on about 50% of days which made afternoon naps as much a necessity as a luxury). During a dive at Lau Lau Reef, we saw one of the species we were most excited about in Raja Ampat: the [wobbegong shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobbegong), a large, flat, camouflaged shark patterned with intricate mottled markings and a fleshy fringe of dermal lobes around its mouth which looks like dendritic coral (the word “wobbegong” comes from an Australian Aboriginal word which means “shaggy beard”).

<br/>
<br/>


Wayag, Raja Ampat (April 7-9, 2025) 
======

We next took the boat up to a new homestay on West Waigeo and then crossed 45min over to Wayag, the poster-child of Raja Ampat whose dramatic limestone karst island formations and turquoise lagoons are featured on all the tourism websites. Despite this, we saw virtually no one there! Seriously, I think we saw **less than 5** other boats over three days snorkeling up in Wayag.

![Wayag-1](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1OMuorCb61CQqcNNWXg5HyiX-j0S-BZiO&sz=w1000)
_Views of Wayag_

The only downside of being out as far as Wayag is that there aren’t any air compressors around to refill tanks to go diving (unless you’re on a liveaboard). As a consequence, most of our days there were spent boating to different reefs to go snorkeling which I was sure couldn’t be as good as the diving (thankfully I was proven super wrong). The snorkeling sites there were every bit as good as the amazing dive sites off of Kri (so if you’re on the fence about visiting because you’re not PADI certified, don’t be!). Since I don’t have an underwater camera rig, we couldn’t get any pictures of our dive/snorkeling sites from Raja Ampat and I’ll try not to information-dump all the marine life we saw. BUT some highlights were snorkeling close-up with about 20 black-tip sharks by Wayag’s North Ranger Station, seeing massive [humphead parrotfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_humphead_parrotfish), **giant** clams, lots of different species of [nudibranch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudibranch), a [peacock mantis shrimp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontodactylus_scyllarus) (one of my favorite species of all time due to a number of their crazy evolutionary adaptations), and [feather stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinoid).

_Black tip sharks by the beach at the North Wayag Ranger Station_

Due in no small part to how little human traffic Wayag receives, the coral gardens here were, without a doubt, the most extensive, diverse, and pristine we’d ever seen. During most of our snorkeling trips, at any point in time there would be between 500-1000 fish in our fields of view (not an exaggeration - Sara and I spent a lot of time trying to estimate this accurately and, if anything, it’s probably an underestimate).

_Views of Piaynemo from our viewpoint hike (these islands are also featured on the 100,000 bank note!)_

Saying goodbye to Wayag, we boated down to Piaynemo, and hiked up to a viewpoint with Yance during which we saw a common paradise-kingfisher perched right off the trail. We dropped our stuff off at our new homestay then went snorkeling off of the huge vertical coral wall called Fam Wall. As we boated around that afternoon, Pak Guru would stop and talk to the other captains or fishermen to ask about manta sightings; we’d told him that swimming with mantas 5 years ago in Komodo was one of the highlights of that trip and he was determined to find us another chance. We eventually learned that they’d been seen off the jetty of a resort nearby so we boated over later that afternoon and jumped in with our snorkels as soon as we saw one breaching. Happened to get a nice close-up with a ~8ft reef manta who’d lost its tail (Pak Guru simply said “shark”) as well as about a million tiny jellyfish that immediately stung us everywhere (especially since we were never wearing our wetsuits since the 28C water was so warm).

_Most of the homestays in Raja Ampat are constructed on stilts over the water_

The next day morning we dove Melissa’s Garden, one of my favorite dives of the trip (highlights: 1000+ schooling fish, tiny [Pygmy seahorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_seahorse), giant [Napoleon fish/humphead wrasse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphead_wrasse)). I also made a fish friend on this dive - a ~1in juvenile golden trevally that stayed close to my tank and would often swim right in front of my mask for the entire last 30min of the dive. Sara thinks he just liked me but a better guess would be that these juveniles are known to hang around larger fish, or even sharks, to escape notice and predation until they grow up (they can grow up to 1m long!). After our surface interval, we headed to Batu Rufas, a beautiful vertical coral wall with good macro diving where we saw lots of nudibranchs and ended in the sunny shallows surrounded by massive schools of fusilier.

_Pasir Timbul, the low-tide sandbank where Sara and I passed our 1hr surface interval between dives_

We headed to a new homestay (Avin Sea Homestay) after our dives and immediately set back out to find some more reef mantas which we’d heard had been seen that morning around Arborek. We were lucky to see 3-4 of them this time, and repeatedly jumped off the boat whenever they got close to swim with them for a few minutes each time before they zoomed off. However, the greater number of mantas was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of jellyfish there - the water was absolutely swarming with them (unsurprising since they’re one of the manta’s favorite foods). After 5 short snorkels with them, my arms, legs, and face were already stinging and itchy so we called it a day and headed back on the boat.

_Sunset from Yenkoranu Homestay_

For our last 4 days in Raja Ampat, we headed back to Kri Island which is where most divers stay since it’s pretty accessible from the main island Waigeo and a short boat ride away from most of Raja Ampat’s famous dive sites. We stayed in Yenkoranu Homestay since that’s where Pak Guru works off and on as a dive guide and where our friend Stubbs spends most of his time in Raja Ampat, and they were able to get us a discount on our rooms, gear, and dive tanks.

_Sara hanging out in a hammock at Yenkoranu_

Over the nest 4 days, we dove 8 times around Kri and spent our downtime either napping (its weird how exhausting diving is considering you don’t really feel like you’re exerting yourself much but it’s definitely exhausting) or, when we had the energy, snorkeling off of the Yenkoranu jetty at their house reef. Without going into too much detail, our last 4 days of diving were at:

<br/> -Cape Kri _(nicer current this time compared to our first dive)_
<br/> -Matthias Reef _(saw giant **oceanic** mantas (~2x the size of reef mantas) this time!)_
<br/> -Chicken Reef _(forgot to take notes for this dive…)_
<br/> -Ransiwor Reef _(first night dive!)_
<br/> -Mioskon _(chromodoris coi, a parrotfish bit my fin…)_
<br/> -Pulau Wai Airplane Wreck _(first wreck dive around a sunken WWII plane at 34m!)_
<br/> -Yenkoranu Jetty _(sunset drift dive)_
<br/> -Yenbuba Jetty _(saw a super cool camouflaged octopus)_

Besides diving, we took another stab at seeing the birds-of-paradise (BOPs) that live in Raja Ampat. We got up at 4am one morning to boat the 45min to Waigeo but had **terrible** luck. After trekking through the jungle for almost an hour to the first site, our guide got a call that the Wilson BOP no longer visits there so we attempted a second site to see the Red BOP which are usually a sure thing. However, once we got to the site, we noticed 3 large eagles/kites sitting in a tree by the clearing which had scared all but one of the BOPs off. We did get a decent look at the one remaining Red BOP but it was relatively far away and took off for a safer tree after a few minutes. We next visited a third site to try for the Wilson’s again but after waiting there in light rain for an hour, our guide decided that it wasn’t going to show because of the weather so we went home disappointed (our guide very kindly only charged us for the Red since the Wilson never showed).

The morning of our last day, we got up at 4am again to boat 1hr to Batanta Island so we could look for birds along the river there. We boated up the narrow river then jumped off when it got shallow enough to hike upstream to scan for birds. Hiked for ~3hrs round-trip with Pak Guru and a local guide, and saw lots of hornbills, flying parrots, and an azure kingfisher before heading back to Yenkoranu Homestay.

Since it was our last night, Pak Guru assembled a couple friends to play us some local music as a send-off. After dinner, we hung out on the jetty with a group of them playing music and drinking Bintang (both the brand of beer and basically the word for beer in Indonesian) until 11pm when we decided to call it a night due to our early 4am wake-up that morning (though we heard them playing into the night until at least 3am!).

After two weeks in Raja Ampat, we packed up our stuff and headed back to Wasai to catch the ferry to Sorong to spend the night before our flight out to Vietnam the next day. Like all those other divers had told us, Raja Ampat was hands-down the best diving and snorkeling we’d ever done (I joked to Stubbs that the worst diving in Raja Ampat was comparable to or better than the best diving we’d done in any other country). We’re a bit worried that we’ve ruined all other future dive trips for ourselves by setting the bar so high… but an easy solution for that is to just plan our next dive trip back in Raja Ampat and coordinate with Stubbs so that we’ll overlap next time!
