I started recording my birding life list on our honeymoon in the Caribbean in April of 2023. About a year and a half later, Sara and I have seen ~320 bird species (primarily in North America) and set a goal of reaching 1000 while we travel! We record all of our sightings using the Cornell Lab of Ornithology resources Merlin and eBird [HYPERLINK NEEDED].

When we decided to take the plunge and go travel for a year, I thought it would be a good opportunity to dive into bird photography as a hobby. Here are some of my first bird shots using the Canon EOS R7 with its kit zoom lens (18-150mm).

My friend Neel lent me his 100-400mm telephoto lens to shoot with while traveling and I got lucky in Muskoka and managed to get a clear shot of a pilleated woodpecker as the inaugural shot with this lens!
