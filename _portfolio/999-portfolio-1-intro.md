I started recording my birding life list on our honeymoon in the Caribbean in April of 2023. About a year and a half later, Sara and I have seen ~320 bird species (primarily in North America) and set a goal of reaching 1000 while we travel! We record all of our sightings using the Cornell Lab of Ornithology resources [Merlin](https://merlin.allaboutbirds.org/) and [eBird](https://ebird.org/).

When we decided to go travel for a year, I thought it would be a good opportunity to dive into bird photography as a hobby. Here are some of my first bird shots using the Canon EOS R7 with its kit zoom lens (RF-S 18-150mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM).

My friend Neel lent me his telephoto lens (RF 100-400mm F5.6-8.0 IS USM) to shoot with while traveling and I got lucky in Muskoka and managed to get a clear shot of a pileated woodpecker by the lake as my inaugural shot with this lens!
