About
======

My name’s Robin Yeo and I’m a biological data scientist specializing primarily in epigenomics, protein engineering, and machine learning. I received my B.Sc. in Biological Engineering from MIT and my Ph.D. in Genetics in the Brunet Lab at Stanford University. After 10 years living in the Bay Area, my wife and I quit our jobs to go travel and work on some personal projects/goals. Over the course of 2024/2025, we’ll be traveling through North America, Southeast Asia, and South America.

Research Background
======
PhD in genetics with extensive genomics and bioinformatics experience including next-generation sequencing analysis and machine learning/deep learning expertise. 15+ years of research experience including molecular biology and genetic manipulation in numerous in vitro and in vivo systems. Expert in CRISPR-Cas systems and their therapeutic applications. Strong independent and collaborative publication record in both primary research and scientific literature reviews. Passionate about genome editing, aging biology, epigenetics, and neuroscience.

## _C. elegans_ Metabolism, Epigenetics, and Reproduction

For over 10 years, I got to study _C. elegans_, one of my favorite invertebrates and model organisms across various experimental and computational projects in the Guarente Lab (MIT), Mair Lab (Harvard), and Brunet Lab (Stanford). My first _C. elegans_ project involved investigating the mechanisms of action underlying the Sirtuin family’s critical role in organismal aging in the Guarente Lab. This led to a project in Will Mair’s lab on elucidating AMPK and CRTC-1’s role in cellular energy homeostasis in the context of _C. elegans_ aging [(Cell, 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25723162/). Shifting from metabolism to epigenetics in the Brunet Lab, I then co-authored a paper with Dr. Aaron Daugherty in which we profiled the chromatin accessibility landscape of the _C. elegans_ genome throughout development in order to identify novel cis-regulatory elements (I.e. distal enhancers) that regulated gene activity in a tissue-specific manner [(Genome Research, 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29141961/). As I moved from wetlab to drylab research, I had the opportunity to collaborate with my baymate Dr. Lauren Booth on her projects elucidating the underlying genetic mechanisms of male-induced demise during _C. elegans_ reproduction [(elife, 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31282863/)[(Nature Aging, 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37118502/).
