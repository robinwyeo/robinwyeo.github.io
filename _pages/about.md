About
======
My name’s Robin Yeo and I’m a computational genomicist specializing primarily in epigenomics, protein engineering, and deep learning. I received my BSc in bioengineering from MIT and my PhD in Genetics in the Brunet Lab at Stanford University. After 10 years living in the Bay Area, my wife and I quit our jobs to go travel and work on some personal projects. Over the course of 2024/2025, we’ll be traveling through North America, Southeast Asia, and South America.


Research Background
======
PhD in genetics with extensive genomics and bioinformatics experience including next-generation sequencing analysis and machine learning/deep learning expertise. 15+ years of research experience including molecular biology and genetic manipulation in numerous in vitro and in vivo systems. Expert in CRISPR-Cas systems and their therapeutic applications. Strong independent and collaborative publication record in both primary research and scientific literature reviews. Passionate about genome editing, aging biology, epigenetics, and neuroscience.
